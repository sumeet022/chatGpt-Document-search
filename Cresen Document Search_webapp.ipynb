Senior deaths from COVID– 19 are down 80 percent since \\nJanuary —down 80 percent —because of all of you. And more than half of all the adults in \\nAmerica have gotten at least one shot.  \\nAt a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked the  nurse —I said, \"What\\'s it \\nlike?\" She looked at me , and she said, \"It\\'s like every shot is giving a dose of hope\" —was her \\nphrase. \"A dose of hope.\"  \\nA dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune \\ndisease —wrote to me, said she\\'s worried —that she was worrying about bringing the virus home. \\nShe said she then got vaccinated at a large site, i n her car. She said she sat in her car, when she \\ngot vaccinated and just cried , cried out of joy and cried out of relief.  \\nParents seeing  the smiles on their kids\\' faces, for those who are able to go back to school \\nbecause the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.  \\nGrandparents', \"hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a \\nwindow to say goodbye.  It means everything. Those things mean e verything.  \\nYou know, there's still —you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans —\\nthere's still more work to do to beat this virus. We can't let our guard down.  \\nBut tonig ht I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past \\nhundred days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical \\nachievements —logistical achievements —this country has ever seen.  \\nWhat else have we done in those first hundred days?  \\nWe kept our commitment —Democrats and Republicans—of sending $1,400 rescue checks \\nto 85 percent of American households. We've already sent more than 160 million checks out the \\ndoor. It's making the difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people, it's making all the difference in the world.  \\nThe single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said\", \"she couldn't work, but she said the relief \\ncheck put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment.  A \\ngrandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor , \\nsomething she said she put off for months because she didn't have the money.  \\nOne of the  defining images, at least from my perspective, in  this crisis has been cars lined \\nup, cars lined up for miles. And not people who just barely ever start those cars, nice cars lined up \\nfor miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.  I don't know about you, but I didn't \\never think I'd see that in America. And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their \\nown, these people are in this position.  \\nThat's why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of \\nAmericans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.  We're also providing rental \\nassistance—you all know this, but the American people, I want\", \"to make sure they understand —\\nkeeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.  \\nDuring these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act \\nwhen I established the special signup period to do that —800,000 in that period.  We're making \\none of the largest one -time ever investments—ever —in improving health care for veterans. \\nCritical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we're on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.  \\nAnd, in the process, while this was all go ing on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 \\nnew jobs in 100 days , more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.  The\", '3 International Monetary Fund is now estimating our  economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 \\npercent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four \\ndecades.  \\nAmerica is moving —moving forward—but we can\\'t stop now.  We\\'re in competition with \\nChina and other countries to win the 21st c entury. We\\'re at a great inflection point in history. We \\nhave to do more than just build back better —I mean , \"build back.\" We have to build back better. \\nWe have to compete more strenuous ly than we have.  \\nThroughout our history, if you think about it, public investment i n infrastructure has literally \\ntransformed America: our attitudes, as well as our opportunities.  The transconti nental railroad, \\nthe interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United \\nStates of America.  Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of \\nopportunity.  Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon—now we\\'re', \"on Mars—discovering \\nvaccines,  gave us the i nternet , and so much more.  \\nThese are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the \\nGovernment was in a position to make. Time and again, they propel us into the future.  That's why \\nI proposed the American Jobs Plan , a once-in -a-generation investment in America itself. This is \\nthe largest jobs plan since World War  II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation \\ninfrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, \\nrail corridors, transit lines. \\nIt's clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 \\nschools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water , a clear \\nand present danger to our children's health.  \\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the N ation's lead pipes and \\nservice lines so every American can drink clean water. And , in the process, it will create\", \"thousands an d thousands of good- paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with \\nhigh-speed internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn't have it.  This is \\ngoing t o help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st -century economy.  \\nAnd I 'm asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would ——  \\nVice President Kamala D. Harris. Of course.  \\nThe President.  ——because I know it will get done.  \\nIt creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, \\ncatastrophic failures, with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter \\nstorms.  The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission \\nlines needed to build a re silient and fully clean grid. We can do that.  \\nLook, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to \\ntheir careers.  Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic —2\", \"million , and too often bec ause they couldn't get the care they needed to care for their child or care \\nfor an elderly parent who needs help.  \\nEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to g et homecare \\nfor their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it's not important, check out in \\nyour own district , Democrat or Republican. Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern —\\nalmost as much as their children —is taking care o f an elderly loved one who can't be left alone. \\nMedicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our \\ncaregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.\", '4 For too long, we\\'ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the \\nclimate crisis: \"jobs.\" Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think \"climate change,\" I think \"jobs.\"  \\nThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more \\nenergy -efficient buildings and homes ; electrical workers—IBEW members —installing 500,000 \\ncharging stations along our highways so we can own the electric car market. Farmers —farmers \\nplanting cover cr ops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.  \\nLook, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can\\'t be \\nbuilt in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None. No reason. So, folks, there\\'s no reason \\nwhy American workers can\\'t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I \\nmean, there is no reason. We have this capacit y. We have the brightest, best  trained people in the \\nworld.  \\nThe American Jobs Plan is going to', 'create millions of good-paying jobs —jobs Americans \\ncan raise a family on —as my dad would t hen say, \"with a little breathing room.\"  And all the \\ninvestments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: b uy American. Buy \\nAmerican.  And I might note, parenthetically , that does not violate any trade agreement. It\\'s been \\nthe law since the thirties : buy American.  \\nAmerican tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in Americ a to \\ncreate American jobs. That\\'s the way it\\'s supposed to be and it will be in this administration. And \\nI made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been strenuously \\nlimited. It will be American products. \\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of \\nyou—so many of the folks I grew up with—feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that\\'s so \\nrapidly changing i t\\'s frightening.  I want to speak directly to you. Because if you think about it,', 'that\\'s what people are most worried about: \"Can I fit in?\"  \\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions \\nof dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is an 8 -year program. These are good -\\npaying jobs that can\\'t be outsourced.  \\nNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require \\na college degree; 75 percent don\\'t require an associate\\'s degree.  The American Jobs Plan is a blue-\\ncollar blueprint to build America. That\\'s what it is.  \\nAnd it recognizes something I\\'v e always said in this Chamber and the other. Good guys and \\nwomen on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn\\'t build this country. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. So that\\'s why I\\'m calling on Congress to pass the \\nProtect the Right to Organize Act —the PRO Act —and send it to my desk so we can support the \\nright to unionize.  \\nAnd by the way, while you\\'re thinking about sending things to my', \"desk—[ laughter ]—let's \\nraise the minimum wage to $15. No one —no one working 40 hours a week—no one working 40 \\nhours a week should live below  the poverty line.  \\nWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. And while we're doing this, \\nlet's get the Paych eck Fairness Act to my desk as well —equal pay. It's been much too long. And \\nif you're wondering whether it's too long, look behind me.  \\nAnd finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and \\ndevelopment on record. We will see more technological change— and some of you know more \\nabout this than I do—we'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the \\nlast 50. That's how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.\", \"5 And we're falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.  Decades ago, we used to \\ninvest 2 pe rcent of our gross domestic product in America —2 percent of our gross domestic \\nproduct —in research and development.  \\nToday, Mr. Secretary, that's less than 1 percent. Ch ina and other countries are closing in fast. \\nWe have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, \\nbiotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.  \\nThe Secretary of Defense can tell you —and those of you on—who work on national security \\nissues know—the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA—the Defense Advanced \\nResearch Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here —and that's been a long time \\nago—to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security—that's their only job. And it's \\na semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the \\ndiscovery of the internet  to GPS and so much more that 's enhanced\", \"our security.  \\nThe National Institute of Health —the NIH—I believe, should create a similar Advanced \\nResearch Projects Agency for Health. And that would —here's what it would do. It would have a \\nsingular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer's, \\ndiabetes, and cancer.  \\nI'll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President —\\nalmost $9 million going to NIH. And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I'll ne ver \\nforget you standing , Mitch, and saying you'd name it after my deceased son. It meant a lot.  \\nBut so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who di ed of cancer. I can \\nthink of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. So let's end cancer \\nas we know it. It's within our power. It's within our power to do it.  \\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we're talking about, have often had \\nbipartisan support in the past. Vice\", \"President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with \\nDemocrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican \\nSenators who just put forward their own proposal.  \\nSo let's get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the \\ndeep discussions. I'd like to meet with those who have ideas that are different —they think are \\nbetter. I welcome those ideas.  \\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, \\ndoing nothing is not an option. Look, we can't be so busy competing with one another that we \\nforget the competition  that we have with the rest of the world to win t he 21st century.  \\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi: traveled over 17,000 \\nmiles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called \\nto congratulate me, we had a 2 -hour discussion. He's deadly earnest about becoming the most\", \"significant, consequential nation in the world. He and others —autoc rats—think that democracy \\ncan't compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.  \\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once -in-a-\\ngeneration investment in our families and our children. That's why I've introduced the American \\nFamilies Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.  \\nFirst is access to a good education. When this N ation made 12 years of public education \\nuniversal in the last century, it made us the best  educated, best  prepared Nation in the world. It's, I \\nbelieve, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st —in the 20th \\ncentury.\", '6 But the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, \\nparenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, \"Okay, \\nwe\\'re going to deci de what we do in terms of g overnment providing for free education,\" I wonder \\nwhether we\\'d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I \\ndoubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st \\ncentury.  That\\'s why my American Families Plan guarantees 4  additional years of public education \\nfor every person in America, starting as early as we can.  \\nThe great universiti es of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows \\nthat adding 2 years of universal high -quality preschool for every 3 -year -old and 4 -year-old, no \\nmatter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the \\nway through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of', 'graduating and going on \\nbeyond graduation.  The research shows when a young child goes to school —not daycare—they \\nare far mor e likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.  \\nWhen you add 2 years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the \\ndynami c. We can do that.  \\nAnd we\\'ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, \\nTribal Colleges, Minority -Serving Institutions. The reason is: They don\\'t have the endowments, \\nbut their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy —all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.  \\nJill is a community co llege professor who teaches today as First Lady. She\\' s long said —if \\nI\\'ve heard it once, I\\'ve heard it a thousand times: \"Joe, any country that outeducates us is going to \\noutcompete us.\" She\\'ll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill.', \"Second thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable \\nchildcare. We guarantee—and I'm proposing a legislation to guarantee that low - and middle -\\nincome families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children \\nup to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime.  \\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally pr ovide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and \\nmedical leave —family and medical leave. We're one of the few industrial countries in the world . \\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their \\nloved ones —a parent, a spouse, or child.  \\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of \\nAmericans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for ever y child in a family. Up to $3,000 per \\nchild, if they're under 6  years of age—I mean, excuse me—under —over [under ]\\n* 6 years of age, \\nand $3,600 for\", \"children over 6  years of age.  \\nWith two parents, two kids, that's $7,200 in the pockets that's going to help to take care of \\nyour family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child ]* \\npoverty in half. And we can afford it.  So we did that in the last piece of legislation we passed. But \\nlet's extend that c hildcare tax credit at least through the end of 2025.  \\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered health  care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy \\ntheir coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that's really popular on this side of the \\naisle. [Laughter ] But let's make that provision permanent so their premiums don't go back up.  \\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I'm going to work with Congress to address, this year, other \\ncritical priorities for American families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"7 of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women's health. And the \\npandemic has demonstrated how badly —how badly—it's needed. Let's lower deductibles for \\nworking families on the Affordable Care —in the Affordable Care Act. And let's lower \\nprescription drug costs.  \\nWe know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how \\noutrageously expensive drugs are in America.  In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices \\nof anywhere in the world right here in America —nearly three times —for the same drug, nearly \\nthree times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can.  \\nLet's do what we've always talked about for all the years I was down here in this body —in \\nCongress. Let's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. And by the way, i t won't just help people on Medicare,  it will \\nlower prescription drug costs for everyone.  \\nAnd the\", \"money we save, which is bill ions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable \\nCare Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. \\nIt's within our power to do it; let's do it now. We've talked about it long enough. Democrats and \\nRepublicans , let's get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health  care should be a \\nright  and not a privilege in America.  \\nSo how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without \\nincreasing the deficits. Let's start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on \\npeople making less than $400,000. It's —but it's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 \\npercent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair shar e. Just their fair share.  \\nSometimes , I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be \\nable to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.  \\nA recent study shows that 55 of the\", \"nation's biggest corporations paid zero Federal tax last \\nyear. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade \\ntaxes through ta x havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit \\nfrom tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It's not right.  \\nWe're going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pa y for the public \\ninvestments their businesses will benefit from as well. And w e're going to reward work, not just \\nwealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans— those making \\nover $400,000 or more —back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he \\nstarted: 39.6 percent. That's where it was when George W. was President.  \\nWe're going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million \\ndollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a\", 'paycheck. We\\'re only going to affect three -tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by tha t action —\\nthree-tenths of 1 percent.  And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires \\nwho cheat on their taxes. It\\'s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that ar e left, right, \\nand center.  \\nI\\'m not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden—additional tax burden to \\nthe middle class in this country. They\\'re already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair , \\nfiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.  \\nWhen you hear someone say that they don\\'t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or \\ncorporate America, ask them: \"Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to \\ncut?\"', '8 Look, the big tax cut of 2017, remember, it was supposed to pay for itself —that was how it \\nwas sold —and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a \\nhuge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.  \\nInstead of using the tax saving to rai se wages and invest in research and development, it \\npoured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their \\nworkers is now among the largest in history.  According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what \\nthe average w orker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the —below a hundred.  \\nThe pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the \\npandemic : working and middle  class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in \\nAmerica saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion , in the same exact period. Let me \\nsay it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during', 'this pande mic. And \\nthey\\'re now worth more than $4 trillion.  \\nMy fellow Americans, trickle-down—trickle -down—economics has never worked , and it\\'s \\ntime to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. Yo u know, there\\'s a broad \\nconsensus of economists— left, right, center —and they agree what I\\'m proposing will help create \\nmillions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest  value \\ninvestments we can make as a Nation. \\nI\\'ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our \\npower.  In my conversations with world leaders— and I\\'ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now —\\nI\\'ve made it known—I\\'ve made it known—that America is back. And you know what they say? \\nThe comment that I hear most of all from them is they say : \"We see America is back , but for how \\nlong? But for how long?\"  \\nMy fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we\\'re back, but that we\\'re back to stay \\nand that we aren\\'t going to go it', \"alone. We're going to do it by leading with our allies. No one \\nnation can deal with all the crises of our time—from te rrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass \\nmigration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well  as experi encing —what we're experiencing now \\nwith pandemics.  \\nThere's no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply , as it grows \\nto meet our nee ds—and we're meeting them —will become an arsenal f or vaccines for other \\ncountries, just as America was the ars enal of democracy for the world  and, in consequence, \\ninfluenced the world.  \\nBut every American will have access before that occur s—every American will have acce ss \\nto be fully covered by COVID– 19 from the vaccines we have.  \\nLook, the climate crisis is not our fight alone , it's a global fi ght. The United States accounts, \\nas all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for \\n85 percent. That's why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris accord\", \"—because if we do \\neverything perfectly, it's not going to ultimately matter. \\nI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the \\nmajor economies of the world—China, Russia, India, the European Union—and I said I'd do it in \\nmy firs t hundred days.  \\nI want to be very blunt about it: I had— my attempt was to make sure that the world could \\nsee there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensus—the \\nconsensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth \\nand opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world.  If you've \\nwatched any of it —and you were all busy; I'm sure you didn't have much time —that's what \\nvirtually every nation said, even the ones that aren't doing their fair share.\", '9 The investments I\\'ve proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that \\nbenefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the \\nglobal economy, including China.  \\nMy discussions—in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, \"We welcome the \\ncompetition. We\\'re not looking for conflict.\" But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America\\'s interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state—to state -owned operations \\nand enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.  \\nI also told President Xi that we\\'ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo -Pacific, just \\nas we do with NATO in Europe, not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. I told him what I\\'ve \\nsaid to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments—our commitment to human rights and fundamental', \"freedoms and to our alliances.  \\nAnd I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic \\nhuman rights are being so blatantly violated. An American President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea, the most unique idea in history: We are \\ncreated, all of us, equal. It's who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we're dealing with the American idea.  \\nWith regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I  made very clear to Putin th at \\nwe're not going to seek—excuse me —escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they \\nturn out to be true. And they turned out to be true , so I responded directly and proportionally to \\nRussia's interference in our elections and the cyber  attacks on our G overnment and our business. \\nThey did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.  \\nBut we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interest. We did\", \"it when we extended the \\nNew START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we're working to do it on climate change. But he \\nunderstands we will  respond.  \\nOn Iran and North Korea—nuclear programs that present serious threats to American \\nsecurity and the security of the world —we're going to be working closely with our allies to \\naddress the threats posed by bot h of these countries through diplomacy, as well as stern \\ndeterrence.  \\nAnd American leadership means ending the fore ver war in Afghanistan. We have, without \\nhyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a war  zone.  Today , we have servicemembers \\nserving in the same war  zone as their parents did. We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who \\nwere not yet born on 9/11.  \\nThe war in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be \\nmultigenerational undert akings of nation -building. We went to Afghanistan to\", \"get terrorists —the \\nterrorists who attacked us on 9/11 —and we said we would follow Usama bin Laden to the gates \\nof hell to do it. If you've been to the upper Kunar Valley, you've kind of seen the gates of hell. \\nAnd we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of A l Qai da in \\nAfghanistan. And after 20 years of value—valor and sacrifice, it's time to bring those troops \\nhome.  \\nLook, even as we do, we will maintain an over -the-horizon capacity to suppress future \\nthreats to the homeland. And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has—terrorism has metastasized. The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan. And those of you in the \\nintelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al\", '10 Qaida and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and \\nbeyond.  \\nAnd we won\\'t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal \\nterrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism. We\\'re not going to ignore \\nthat either. \\nMy fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this N ation . It was \\nnearly a year ago, before her father\\'s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd\\'s young daughter. She\\'s a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the \\neye. And she looked at  me and she said, \"My daddy changed the world.\" Well, after the \\nconviction of George Floyd\\'s murderer, we can see how right she was if we have the courage to \\nact as a Congress.  \\nWe\\'ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans. Now is our opportunity \\nto make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our', \"communities, and they serve them honorably.  I know them. I know they want to \\nhelp meet this moment as well.  \\nMy fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement \\nand the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact \\npolice reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already.  I know Republicans have \\ntheir own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate. We need to work together to find a consensus. But let's get it done next month, by the first \\nanniversary of George Floyd's death.  \\nThe country supports this reform, and Congress should act —should act. We have a giant \\nopportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice —real justice. And with the \\nplans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America \\nand American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity —good jobs, good schools,\", \"affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two \\ngenerations because you have an access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of \\nmore Americans: Black, White, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.  \\nLook, I also want to thank the United States Senate for v oting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID –19 \\nHate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. You acted decisively. And \\nyou can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we've seen over the past year —this \\npast year and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, \\nwhich I will gladly, anxiously sign.  \\nI also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans. To \\nall transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want \\nyou to know your President has your back.  \\nAnother thing: Let's authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law\", 'for 27 \\nyears. Twenty -seven years ago, I wrote it. It  will close the —the act that has to be authori zed now \\nwill close the \"boyfriend\" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said:  \\n\"This is an abuser. You can\\'t own a gun.\" It\\'s to close that loophole that existed.  You know, it\\'s \\nestimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America— 50 \\na month. Let\\'s pass it and save some lives.  \\nAnd I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.  The \\nflag at the White House was still flying at half -mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in \\nGeorgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.  And, in the week in', '11 between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 \\nshot dead.  \\nI know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the ninetie s, we passed universal \\nbackground checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds \\nthat can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. \\nCheck out the report over  10 years. But  in the early twenty —2000s, the law expired, and we\\'ve \\nseen daily bloodshed since. I\\'m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn\\'t see bloodshed.  \\nMore than 2  weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I \\nknow —the survivors and f amilies who lost loved ones to gun violence —I laid out several  of the \\nDepartment of Justice actions that are being taken to  impact on this epidemic.  \\nOne of them is banning so- called \"ghost guns.\" The se are homemade guns built from a kit \\nthat includes directions on how to finish the firearm. The', \"parts have no serial numbers, so they \\nshow up at crime scenes,  and they can't be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren't \\nrequired to pass any background check. Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit \\nand, within 30 minutes , have a weapon that's lethal. But no more.  \\nAnd I will do everything in my power to protect the American peop le from this epidemic of \\ngun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational , but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of \\nDemocrat ic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of \\nguns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't \\nbe done. We did it before, and it worked.  \\nTalk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They'll tell you there's no possible \\njustification for having 100 rounds in a weapon. What do you think: deer are wearing Kevlar \\nvests? [Laughter\", '] No, what\\'s —they\\'ll tell you that there are too many people today who are able \\nto buy a gun,  but shouldn\\'t be able to buy a gun.  \\nThese kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, \\nincluding many gun owners. The country supports reform and is —and Congress should act.  \\nThis shouldn\\'t be a red or blue issue. An d no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You \\ncan\\'t yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater. From the very beginning, there were certain guns, \\nweapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons \\never.  We\\'re not changing the Constitution; we\\'re being reasonable. I think this is not a Democrat \\nor Republican issue , I think it\\'s an American issue.  \\nAnd here\\'s what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to Amer ica. Let\\'s \\nend our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we\\'ve done nothing about it. It\\'s time to fix', \"it.  \\nOn day one of my P residency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration \\nbill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for  high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it \\nso over 11 million undocumented folks —the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We \\ncan actually —if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to —so take a close look at \\nit. \\nWe have to —also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to —\\nto our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, \\nthe gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.  \\nWhen I was President, my President —when I was Vice President, the President asked me to \\nfocus on provi ding the help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep\", '12 people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last \\nadministration decided it was not worth it. I\\'m restoring the program and as ked Vice President \\nHarris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this. I have absolute confidence she\\'ll get the job done.  \\nNow, look, if you don\\'t like my plan, le t\\'s at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs \\nto pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for \"dream ers,\" the young peopl e who \\nhave only known America as their home. And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural -made —\\nviolence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our \\ntables.  \\nLook, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our \\nhistory. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let\\'s argue over it, let\\'s debate \\nit, but let\\'s', \"act.  \\nAnd if we truly want to restore the soul of America,  we need to protect the sacred right to \\nvote. Most people —more people voted in the last P residential election than any time in American \\nhistory, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebra ted. Instead, it's being \\nattacked.  Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my \\ndesk right away. The country supports it. The Congress should act now.   \\nLook, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this \\nCapitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds.  Lives were put at risk —many \\nof your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrecti on was an \\nexistential crisis, a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did.  \\nBut the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is \\nboth ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic , still vital today. Can our\", \"democracy deliver on its \\npromise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?  Can our de mocracy deliver the most —to the most pressing needs of our \\npeople?  Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart? \\nAmerica's adversaries —the autocrats of the world —are betting we can't. And I promise you, \\nthey're bett ing we can't. They believe we're too full of anger and division and rage.  They look at \\nthe images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. But they are wrong. You know it; I know it. But we have to prove them wrong.  \\nWe have to prove democracy still works , that our G overnment still works and we can deliver \\nfor our people.  In our first hundred days together, we've acted to r estore the people's faith in \\ndemocracy to deliver. We're vaccinating the N ation. We're creating hundreds of thousands of new \\njobs.\", 'We\\'re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.  \\nOpening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice, that\\'s the \\nessence of America. That\\'s democracy in action.  Our Constitution opens with the words —as trite \\nas it sounds —\"We the People\". Well, it\\'s time to remember that \"We the People\" are the \\nGovernment —you and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we \\nhave no control over. It\\'s us. It\\'s \"We the People.\"  \\nIn another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, \"In \\nAmerica, we do our part.\" We all do our part. That\\'s a ll I\\'m asking: that we do our part, all of us. \\nIf we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will. And the future belongs to \\nAmerica.', '13 As I st and here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our \\nNation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic \\nabout America , not because I\\'m President, because what\\'s happening with the American people.  \\nWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and \"We \\nthe People\" did not flinch.  At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart \\nand fail, we came together. We united.  With light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new \\nresolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more \\nperfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one  Nation, and one America.  \\nFolks, as I told every world leader I\\'ve ever met with over the years, it\\'s never ever, ever \\nbeen a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn\\'t.  \\nWe are the United States of America. There is not a single thing —nothing—not hing beyond \\nour', \"capacity. We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together. So let's begin to get together.  \\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience.  \\nN\\nOTE: The President spoke at 9:0 6 p.m. in the House C hamber of the U.S. Capitol. In his \\nremarks, he referred to Se nate Minority Leader  A.

Biden, Jr., 2022 \\nAddress Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union  \\nMarc h 1, 2022 \\nThe President.  Thank you all very , very much. Thank you, please. Thank you so much. \\nMadam  Speaker,  Madam Vice President, and our First Lady  and Second  Gentleman,  Members  of \\nCongress  and the Cabinet,  Justices of the Supreme  Court,  my fellow  Americans:  Last year,  \\nCOVID– 19 kept us apart . This year,  we're finally  together  again.   \\nTonight  we meet  as Democrats,  Republicans,  and Independents,  but most  importantly, as \\nAmericans with a duty to one another , to America,  to the American  people,  and to the \\nConstitution, and an unwavering  resolve that freedom  will always triumph  over tyranny.  \\nSix—[applause ]—thank you. Six days ago, Russia's  Vladimir  Putin  sought  to shake  the very \\nfoundations  of the free world,  thinking he could make  it bend to his menacing  ways. But he badly  \\nmiscalculated . He thought  he\", 'could roll into Ukrain e and the world  would roll over. Instead,  he \\nmet with a wall of strength  he never  anticipated  or imagined . He met the Ukrainian  people .  \\nFrom  President Zelensk iy, their —to every  Ukrainian,  their fearlessness,  their courage,  their \\ndetermination  literally  inspires  the world . Groups  of citizens blocking tanks  with their bodies . \\nEveryone  from  students  to retirees,  to teachers turned soldiers defending  their homeland.  And in \\nthis struggle —President  Zelensk iy said in his speech  to the European  Parliament, \"Light will win \\nover darkness. \" \\nThe Ukrainian  Amba ssador  to the United  States  is here tonight  sitting  with the First Lady . \\nLet each of us, if you\\'re able to stand,  stand  and send an unmistakable  signal  to the world  and \\nUkraine. Thank you. Thank  you, thank  you, thank you. She\\'s bright, she\\'s strong,  and she\\'s \\nresolved . Yes. We, the United  States  of America,  stand  with the Ukrainian  people.  \\nThroughout', \"our history,  we've learned  this lesson:  When  dictators  do not pay a price  for their \\naggression,  they cause more  chaos;  they keep  moving;  and the costs,  the threats to the America—\\nand America,  to the world  keeps rising. That's why the NATO alliance  was created:  to secure \\npeace and stability  in Europe  after World  War II. The United  States is a member,  along with 29 \\nother  nations . It matters. American  diplomacy  matters . American  resolve  matters.  \\nPutin 's latest  attack  on Ukraine was premeditated  and totally  unprovoked. He rejected  \\nrepeated —repeated —efforts  at diplomacy.  He thought  the West and NATO wouldn' t respond . He \\nthought  he could  divide  us at home,  in this Chamber,  in this Nation . He thought  he could divide  \\nus in Europe  as well.   \\nBut Putin  was wrong. We are ready . We are united . And that's what  we did: We stayed  \\nunited.  We prepared  extensively  and carefully . We spent  months  building  coalitions  of other\", \"freedom -loving nations  in Europe  and the Americas to—from  America to the Asian  and African  \\ncontinents  to confront  Putin.  \\nLike many  of you, I spent  countless hours  unifying  our European allies. We shared  with the \\nworld  in advance  what  we knew  Putin  was planning and precisely  how he would try to falsif y and \\njustify  his aggression.  We countered  Russia 's lies with the truth . And now—now  that he's acted,  \\nthe free world  is holding him accountable,  along with 27 members  of the European  Union—\\nincluding  France,  Germany,  Italy—as well as countries  like the United  Kingdom,  Canada,  Japan,  \\nKorea,  Australia,  New Zealand,  and many  others —even Switzerland —are inflicting  pain on \\nRussia and supporting the people  of Ukraine.  Putin  is now isolated  from  the world  more  than he \\nhas ever been.\", \"2 Together,  along  with our allies,  we are right  now enforcing  powerful  economic  sanctions . \\nWe're cutting  off Russia's  largest  banks  from  the international financial  system;  preventing \\nRussia 's Central Bank  from  defending the Russian  ruble,  making Putin 's $630 billion  war fund \\nworthless. We're choking Russia 's access to technology  that will sap its economic  strength  and \\nweaken  its military  for years to come.  \\nTonight  I say to the Russian  oligarchs  and the corrupt  leaders who have bilked  billions  of \\ndollars  off this violent  regime:  No more . The United  States— [applause ]—I mean  it. The United  \\nStates  Department  of Justice is assembling  a dedicated  task force  to go after the crimes  of the \\nRussian  oligarch s. \\nWe're joining  with European allies to find and seize their yachts,  their luxury apartments,  \\ntheir private  jets. We're coming  for your ill-begotten gains.  And tonight  I'm announcing  that we \\nwill join our allies in\", \"closing  off American  air space to all Russian  flights, further isolating  Russia \\nand adding an additional squeeze on their economy .  \\nHe has no idea what 's coming.  The ruble  has already  lost 30 percent  of its value,  the Russian  \\nstock  marke t has lost 40 percent  of its value,  and trading remains suspended.  The Russian  \\neconomy  is reeling,  and Putin  alone  is the one to blame.  \\nTogether  with our allies, we're providing support  to the Ukrainians in their fight  for freedom:  \\nmilitary  assistance,  economic  assistance,  humanitarian  assistance. We're giving  more  than a \\nbillion  dollars  in direct  assistance to Ukraine. And we'll continue  to aid the Ukrainian  people  as \\nthey defend  their country  and help ease their suffering .  \\nBut let me be clear:  Our Forces are not engaged  and will not engage in the conflict with \\nRussian  forces  in Ukraine. Our Forces are not going to Europe  to fight  [in]* Ukraine but to defend  \\nour NATO allies in the event\", \"that Putin  decides to keep  moving west.  For that purpose,  we have  \\nmobilized  American  ground forces,  air squadrons , ship deployments  to protect  NATO countries,  \\nincluding  Poland,  Romania,  Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. And as I've made  crystal  clear,  the \\nUnited  States  and our allies will defend  every  inch of territory  that is NATO territory  with the full \\nforce  of our collective  power —every  single  inch.  \\nAnd we're clear  eyed . The Ukrainians are fighting  back  with pure courage . But the next few \\ndays,  weeks,  and months  will be hard on them.  Putin has unleashed  violence  and chaos. But while  \\nhe may make  gains  on the battlefield, he'll pay a continuing high price  over the long run. And a \\npound of Ukrainian  people —the  proud,  proud people —pound  for pound,  ready  to fight  with \\nevery  inch of energy they have . They 've known 30 years  of independence —have  repeatedly  \\nshown  that they will not tolerate  anyone  who tries to take\", \"their country  backwards.  \\nTo all Americans,  I'll be honest  with you, as I've always promised  I would be. A Russian  \\ndictator  invading a foreign  country  has costs around the world . And I'm taking  robust  action  to \\nmake  sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted  at Russian  economy  and that we use every  tool at \\nour disposal  to protect  American  businesses and consumers.   \\nTonight  I can announce  the United  States  has worked  with 30 other  countries  to release 60 \\nmillion  barrels of oil from  reserves around the world . America will lead that effort,  releasing  30 \\nmillion  barrels of our own Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve. And we stand  ready  to do more  if \\nnecessary,  united  with our allies.  \\nThese steps will help blunt  gas prices here at home . But I know  news about  what 's \\nhappening  can seem  alarming  to all Americans. But I want  you to know:  We're going  to be okay . \\nWe're going to be okay.  \\n                                                 \\n*\", 'White House correction.', \"3 When  the history  of this era is written, Putin 's war on Ukraine will have  left Russia weaker  \\nand the rest of the world  stronger .  \\nWhile  it shouldn' t have  taken  something so terrible  for people  around the world  to see what 's \\nat stake,  now everyone sees it clearly.  We see the unity  among leaders of nations,  a more  unified  \\nEurope,  a more  unified  West.  We see unity  among the people  who are gathering in cities  in large \\ncrowds around the world,  even  in Russia,  to demonstrate their support  for the people  of Ukraine.   \\nIn the battle  between  democracy  and autocracies,  democracies are rising  to the moment , and \\nthe world  is clearly  choosing the side of peace and security.  This is the real test, and it's going  to \\ntake time. So let us continue  to draw inspiration  from  the iron will of the Ukrainian  people.  \\nTo our fellow  Ukrainian  Americans who forged  a deep  bond that connects  our two nations:  \\nWe stand  with you. We stand  with you.\", \"Putin  may circle Kiev with tanks,  but he'll never  gain the \\nhearts and souls  of the Uranian  [Ukrainian ]* people . He'll never  extinguish their love of freedom . \\nAnd he will never,  never  weaken  the resolve  of the free world .  \\nWe meet  tonight  in an America that has lived  through  2 of the hardest  years this Nation  has \\never faced . The pandemic  has been  punishing. And so many  families  are living  paycheck  to \\npaycheck,  struggling  to keep  up with the rising  cost of food,  gas, housing,  and so much  more.   \\nI understand,  like many  of you did. My dad had to leave his home  in Scranton,  Pennsylvania,  \\nto find work . So, like many  of you, I grew  up in a family  when  the price of food went  up, it was \\nfelt throughout  the family; it had an impact.  That's why one of the first things  I did as President  \\nwas fight  to pass the American  Rescue Plan, because people  were hurting . We needed  to act, and \\nwe did. \\nFew pieces of legislation  have  done  more\", 'at a critical  moment  in our history  to lift us out of \\na crisis. It fueled  our efforts  to vaccinate  the Nation  and combat  COVID– 19. It deliv ered \\nimmediate economic  relief  to tens of millions  of Americans. It helped  put food on the table . \\nRemember  those long lines  of cars waiting  for hours  just to get a box of food put in their trunk ? It \\ncut the cost of health  care insurance. And as my dad used to say, it gave  the people  \"just a little \\nbit of breathing room. \" \\nAnd unlike  the $2 trillion  tax cut passed  in the previous  administration  that benefit ed the top \\n1 percent  of Americans,  the American  Rescue Plan——  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  ——the  American  Rescue  Plan helped  working people  and left no one \\nbehind. And,  folks —and  it worked . It worked . It worked  and created  jobs, lots of jobs. In fact, our \\neconomy  created  over 6.5 million  new jobs just last year,  more  jobs in 1 year than ever before  in \\nthe history  of the', \"United  States of America. The economy  grew at a rate of 5.7 last year, the \\nstrongest  growth  rate in 40 years and the first step in bringing  fundamental  change  to our \\neconomy  that hasn't worked for working  people  in this Nation  for too long.  \\nFor the past 40 years,  we were told that tax breaks for those  at the top and benefits would \\ntrickle  down and everyone  would benefit.  But that trickle -down theory  led to a weaker  economic \\ngrowth,  lower  wages,  bigger  deficits,  and a widening gap between  the top and everyone else in \\nthe—in nearly  a century .   \\nLook,  Vice President  Harris and I ran for office —and  I realize we have  fundamental  \\ndisagreements on this—but  ran for office  with a new economic  vision  for America:  invest  in \\nAmerica;  educate Americans;  grow  the workforce;  build  the economy  from  the bottom  up and the \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"4 middle  out, not from  the top down. Because we know —because we know —when  the middle  \\nclass grows,  the poor go way up, and the wealthy  do very well. \\nAmerica used to have  the best roads,  bridges,  and airports  on Earth . And now our \\ninfrastructure  is ranked  13th in the world . We won't be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st \\ncentury  if we don't fix it. That's why it was so important  to pass the bipartisan  infrastructure law. \\nAnd I thank my Republican  friend s who joined  to invest  and rebuild  America, the single  biggest  \\ninvestment  in history .  \\nIt was a bipartisan  effort,  and I want  to thank the members  of both parties who worked  to \\nmake  it happen. We're done  talking  about  infrastructure  weeks. We're now talkin g about  an \\ninfrastructure  decade. And look,  it's going to transform  America  to put us on a path to win the \\neconomic  competition  of the 21st century  that we face with the rest of the world,  particularly  \\nChina.  I've told Xi\", \"Jinping:  It's never  been  a good bet to bet against  the American  people.  \\nWe'll create good jobs for millions  of Americans— modernizing roads,  airports,  ports,  \\nwaterways—a ll across America. And we'll do it to withstand  the devastating  effects of climate  \\ncrisis and promote  environmental  justice. We'll build  a national  network  of 500,000 electric \\nvehicle charging stations;  begin to replace the poisonous  lead pipes  so every  child,  every  \\nAmerican  has clean  water  to drink  at home  and at school .  \\nWe're going to provide  affordable  high-speed  internet  for every  American —rural,  suburban,  \\nurban,  and Tribal communities . Four  thousand projects have  already  been  announced . Many  of \\nyou have  announced them in your districts.  And tonight  I'm announcing that, this year,  we will \\nstart fixing  over 65,000 miles  of highway and 1,500  bridges  in disrepair . And,  folks,  when  we use \\ntaxpayers' dollars  to rebuild  America,  we're going to do it\", \"by buying American . Buy American  \\nproducts . Support  American  jobs.  \\nThe Federal  Government  spends  about  $600  billion  a year to keep  this country  safe and \\nsecure. There 's been  a law on the books  for almost  a century  to make  sure taxpayers ' dollars  \\nsupport  American  jobs and businesses. Every  administration —Democrat  and Republican —says \\nthey'll do it, but we're actually  doing it. We'll buy America n to make  sure everything  from  the \\ndeck  of an aircraft  carrier  to the steel on highway  guardrails  is made  in America from  beginning \\nto end. All of it. All of it.  \\nBut, folks,  to compete for the jobs of the future,  we also need  to level  the playing field with \\nChina  and other  competitors . That's why it's so important  to pass the bipartisan  innovation act \\nsitting  in Congress  that will make  record  investments in emerging  technologies  and American  \\nmanufacturing.  We used to invest  almost  2 percent  of our GDP  in research  and\", 'development . We \\ndon\\'t now. Can\\'t—China  is. \\nLet me give you one example  why it\\'s so important  to pass.  If you travel  20 miles  east of \\nColumbus,  Ohio,  you\\'ll find a thousand  empty  acres of land. It won\\'t look like much . But if you \\nstop and look closely,  you\\'ll see a \"field of dreams ,\" the ground on which  America \\'s future  will be \\nbuilt. That\\'s  where Intel, the American  company  that helped  build Silicon  Valley,  is going to \\nbuild  a $20 billion  semiconductor  \"mega  site,\" up to eight  state-of -the-art factories in one place. \\nTen thousand  new jobs. And in those  factories,  the average job—about  $135—$135,000  a year.  \\nSome  of the most  sophisticated  manufacturing in the world  to make  computer  chips  the size \\nof a fingertip  that power  the world  and everyday  lives,  from  smartphones,  technology  that—the  \\ninternet —technology  that\\'s  yet to be invented.  But that\\'s just the beginning.  \\nIntel\\'s CEO,  Pat Gelsinger,  who is here tonight —and  I', \"don't  know  where Pat is. Pat? There \\nyou go, Pat. Stand  up. Pat came  to see me, and he told me they're  ready  to increase their \\ninvestment  from  $20 billion  to $100  billion. That would  be the biggest  investment  in\", '5 manufacturing in American  history . And all they\\'re waiting  for is for you to pass this bill. So let\\'s \\nnot wait any longer . Send  it to my desk,  I\\'ll sign it, and we will really  take off in a big way.  \\nAnd,  folks,  Intel is not alone . There\\'s  something  happening  in America. Just look around,  \\nand you\\'ll see an amazing  story —the  rebirth  of pride  that comes from  stamping  products  \"Made  \\nin America, \" the revitalization  of American  manufacturing.  Companies  are choosing to build  new \\nfactories here when  just a few years ago, they would  have  gone  overseas. That\\'s what  is \\nhappening.  Ford  is investing $11 billion  in electric vehicles,  creating  11,000  jobs across the \\ncountry.  GM is making the largest  investment  in its history —$7  billion  to build electric vehicles,  \\ncreating  4,000 jobs in Michigan.  All told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were  created  in \\nAmerica last year alone .  \\nAnd, f olks,  powered  by people  I\\'ve met—like  JoJo', 'Burgess from  generations  of union  \\nsteelworkers in Pittsburgh, who\\'s here with us tonight . Where are you, JoJo? There  you go. \\nThanks,  buddy . As Ohio —as Ohio  Senator  Sherrod  Brown  says—[ applause ]—as Sherrod Brown  \\nsays,  \"It\\'s time to bury the label  \\'Rust  Belt.\\' \" It\\'s time to see the—what  used to be called  the Rust \\nBelt become the home  of a significant  resurgence of manufacturing.  \\nAnd with all the bright  spots  in our economy —record  job growth,  higher  wages —too  many  \\nfamilies  are struggling  to keep  up with their bills. Inflation  is robbing them  of gains  they thought  \\notherwise they would be able to feel. I get it. That\\'s why my top priority  is getting  prices unde r \\ncontrol.  \\nLook,  our economy  roared  back  faster  than almost  anyone  predicted,  but the pandemic  \\nmeant  that businesses had a hard time hiring  enough people  because  of the pandemic  to keep  up \\nproduction in their factories. So you didn\\'t  have  people  making those', \"beams  that went  into \\nbuildings  because they were out—the  factory  was closed.  The panic  [pandemic ]* also disrupted \\nthe global  supply  chain . Factories close . When  that happens,  it takes longer  to make  goods  and \\nget them  to the warehouses,  to the stores,  and go—prices  go up. \\nLook at cars last year. One-third  of all the inflation  was because of automobile  sales. There \\nweren 't enough semiconductors to make  all the cars that people  wanted  to buy. And guess what ? \\nPrices of automobiles  went  way up, especially  used vehicles as well.  What —and so we have  a \\nchoice.  One way to fight inflation  is to drive  down wages and make  Americans poorer.  I think  I \\nhave  a better  idea to fight  inflation: Lower  your costs,  not your wages.  \\nAnd,  folks,  that means make  more  cars and semiconductors in America,  more  infrastructure \\nand innovation  in America,  more  goods  moving faster  and cheaper  in America,  more  jobs where \\nyou can earn a good living\", \"in America.  Instead  of relying  on foreign  supply chains,  let's make  it \\nin America.  \\nLook,  economists——  \\nAudience members.  U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! \\nThe Presiden t. Economists ——  \\nAudience members.  U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! \\nThe President.  ——call  this increasing  the productive  capacity  of our economy.  I call it \\nbuilding a better  America. My plan to fight  inflation  will lower  your costs and lower  the deficit . \\nSeventeen  Nobel  laureates in economics said my plan will ease long-term  inflationary  pressures. \\nTop business leaders and, I believe,  most  Americans support  the plan. \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"6 And here' s the plan.  First, cut the cost of prescription  drugs . We pay more  for the same  drug \\nproduced by the same  company  in America than any other  country  in the world.  Just look at \\ninsulin . One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia,  I met a 13-year -old boy, the handsome  \\nyoung man standing up there,  Joshua  Davis. He and his dad both have  type 1 diabetes,  which \\nmeans they need  insulin  every  single  day. Insulin  costs about  $10 a vial to make . That's  what  it \\ncosts the pharmaceutical  company . But drug companies  charge families  like Joshua  and his dad \\nup to 30 times  that amount.  \\nI spoke  with Joshua 's mom . Imagine  what  it's like to look at your child  who needs  insulin  to \\nstay healthy  and have  no idea how in God's  name  you're going to be able to pay for it—what  it \\ndoes to your family, but what  it does to your dignity,  your ability  to look your child  in the eye, to \\nbe the parent  you expect  yourself  to be. I really  mean\", \"it. Think  about  that. That's  what  I think  \\nabout.  You know,  yesterday —Joshua  is here tonight,  but yesterday  was his birthday . Happy  \\nbirthday,  buddy, by the way.  \\nFor Joshua  and 200,000 other  young  people  with type 1 diabetes,  let's cap the cost of insulin  \\nat $35 a month so everyone  can afford  it. And drug companies will do very,  very well—their  \\nprofit  margin.  And while  we're at it—I know  we have  great disagreements on this floor  with \\nthis—let's  let Medicare negotiate  the price of prescription  drugs . They  already  set the price for \\nVA drugs.  Look,  the American  Rescue Plan is helping  millions  of families  on Affordable  Care  \\nAct plans  to save them  $2,400 a year on their health  premiums . Let's close the coverage gap and \\nmake  those  savings  permanent .  \\nAnd second,  let's cut energy costs for families  an average of $500 a year by combating  \\nclimate change.  Let's provide  an investment  and tax credit  to weatherize your home  and\", \"your \\nbusiness to be energy  efficient  and get a tax credit  for it; double America 's clean  energy  \\nproduction in solar,  wind,  and so much  more;  lower  the price of electric vehicles,  saving  another  \\n$80 a month that you've  not going to have  to pay at the pump.  \\nFolks —third —the  third  thing  we can do to change  the standard  of living for hard-working \\nfolks  is cut the cost of childcare. [Applause ] Cut the cost of childcare. Folks, if you live in a major  \\ncity in America,  you can pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. I was a single  dad for 5 \\nyears,  raising  two kids. I had a lot of help though. I had a mom,  a dad, a brother,  and sister  that \\nreally  helped.  But middle  class and working folks  shouldn' t have  to pay more  than 7 percent  of \\ntheir income  to care for their young children .  \\nMy plan would  cut the cost of childcare in half for most  families  and help parents,  including  \\nmillions  of women  who left the workforce  during the\", \"pandemic  because they couldn' t afford  \\nchildcare to be able to get back  to work,  generating  economic  growth.  But my plan doesn 't stop \\nthere. It also includes  home  and long-term  care,  more  affordable  housing,  pre-K for 3- and 4-\\nyear-olds . All of these will lower  costs to families.  \\nAnd under  my plan,  nobody —let  me say this again —nobody  earning less than $400,000 a \\nyear will pay an additional  penny  in new taxes. Not a single  penny.  I may be wrong,  but my guess  \\nis, if we took a secret  ballot in this floor,  that we'd all agree that the present  tax system  ain't fair. \\nWe have  to fix it. I'm not looking to punish  anybody,  but let's make  corporations  and wealthy  \\nAmericans start paying their fair share.  \\nLook,  last year—[applause ]—last  year—and like Chris  Coons  and Tom  Carper and my \\ndistinguished  Congresswoman —we  come  from  the land of corporate America . There are more  \\ncorporations  incorporated in America [Delaware ]* than every\", 'other  State in America combined . \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.', \"7 And I still won 36 years in a row. The point  is, even they understand  they should pay just a fair \\nshare.  \\nLast year,  55 of the Fortune  500 companies  earned  $40 billion  in profit  and paid zero in \\nFederal  taxes.  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  No, look,  it's not fair. That's why I proposed a 15-percent  minimum  tax rate \\nfor corporations . And w e've got—and  that's why in the G–7 and other  meetings overseas we were \\nable to put together —I was able to be somewhat  helpful —130  countries to agree on a global  \\nminimum  tax rate so companies can't get out of paying  their taxes at home  by shipping  jobs and \\nfactories overseas. It will raise billions  of dollars.  \\nAnd that's why I've proposed closing  loopholes  for the very wealthy  who don't pay—who  \\npay a lower  tax rate than a teacher  and a firefighter.  So that's my plan. But we have —we 'll go into \\nmore  detail  later.  I'm going  to grow —we will grow  the economy,  lower  the costs to families.\", \"So \\nwhat  are we waiting  for? Let's get this done . We all know  we've got to make  changes.  \\nFolks, and while  you're at it, confirm  my nominees  for the Federal  Reserve, which  plays  a \\ncritical  role in fighting inflation.  \\nMy plan will not only lower  costs and give families  a fair shot,  it will lower  the deficit. The \\nprevious  administration  not only ballooned  the deficit  with those tax cuts for the very wealthy  and \\ncorporations,  it undermined the watchdogs —the  job of those  to keep  pandemic  relief  funds  from  \\nbeing wasted . Remember  we had those  debates about  wheth er or not those  watchdogs  should be \\nable to see, every  day, how much  money  was being spent,  where it—was it going to the right  \\nplace?  \\nIn my administration, the watchdogs  are back . And we're going after the criminals who stole  \\nbillions  of relief  money  meant  for small  business and millions  of Americans.  And tonight  I'm \\nannouncing that the Justice Department  will soon\", \"name  a chief  prosecutor  for pandemic  fraud .  \\nAnd look—[applause ]—I think  we all agree—thank you—by  the end of this year,  the deficit  \\nwill be down  to less than half what  it was before  I took office , the only President  ever to cut the \\ndeficit  by more  than $1 trillion  in a single  year.  \\nLowering  your costs also meant  demanding more  competition . I'm a capitalist,  but capitalism  \\nwithout  competition  is not capitalism . Capitalism  without  competition  is exploitation. It drives  up \\nprofits  [prices ].* When  corporations  have  to compete,  their profits  go up and your prices go up—\\nwhen  they don't have  to compete.  Small  businesses and family  farmers  and ranchers—I need  not \\ntell some  of my Republican  friends  from  those  States—guess what ? You've got four basic \\nmeatpacking  facilities . That' s it. You play with them  or you don't get to play at all. And you pay a \\nhell of a lot more —a hell of a lot more —because there 's only four.  \\nSee\", \"what's happening  with ocean  carriers  moving goods  in and out of America. During the \\npandemic,  about  half a dozen  or less foreign -owned  companies  raised  prices by as much  as 1,000 \\npercent  and made  record  profits.  Tonight  I'm announcing a crackdown  on those  companies  \\novercharging American  businesses and consumers.  \\nFolks —[applause ]—and as Wall  Street  firms  take over more  nursing homes,  quality  in those  \\nhomes  has gone  down,  and costs  have  gone  up. That ends on my watch.  Medicare is going to set \\nhigher  standards for nursing homes  and make  sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and \\nthat they inspect and they will—looked  at closely.  We're also going to cut costs to keep  the \\neconomy  going strong  and giving  workers  a fair shot;  provide  more  training  and apprenticeships;  \\nhire them  based  on skills, not just their degrees.\", \"8 Let's pass the Paycheck  Fairness Act and paid leave;  raise the minimum  wage to $15 an \\nhour;  and extend  the child tax credit so no one has to raise a family  in poverty . Let's increase Pell \\ngrants;  increase our historic  support  for HBCUs;  and invest  in what  Jill, our First Lady,  who \\nteaches full time,  calls America 's best kept secret:  community  colleges.  \\nLook,  let's pass the PRO  Act. When  a majority  of worke rs want  to form  a union,  they \\nshouldn' t be able to be stopped . When  we invest  in our workers and we build  an economy  from  \\nthe bottom  up and the middle  out, together  we can do something  we haven 't done  in a long time: \\nbuild  a better  America.  \\nFor more  than 2 years,  COVID has impacted  every  decision  in our lives  and the life of this \\nNation . And I know  you're tired, frustrated,  and exhausted . That doesn 't even  count  the close to a \\nmillion  people  who sit at a dining  room  table  or a kitchen  table  and look at an empty\", 'chair  \\nbecause they lost somebody.   \\nBut I also know  this: Because of the progress we\\'ve made,  because of your resilience and the \\ntools  that we have  been  provided by this Congress,  tonight I can say we\\'re moving forward  safely,  \\nback  to a more —normal  routines.  We\\'ve reached  a new moment  in the fight  against  COVID– 19 \\nwhere severe cases are down to a level  not seen since July of last year.  \\nJust a few days ago, the Center  for Disease Control  and Prevention  issued  a new mask  \\nguidelines . Under  the new guidelines,  most  Americans in most  of the country  can now go mask  \\nfree. And based  on projecti ons, more  of the country  will reach  a point  across—that  point  across \\nthe next couple  of weeks.  And thanks  to the progress we\\'ve made  in the past year,  COVID– 19 no \\nlonger  need  control  our lives . I know  some  are talking  about  \"living  with COVID– 19.\" But \\ntonight I say that we never  will just accept  living  with COVID– 19; we\\'ll continue', \"to combat  the \\nvirus  as we do other  diseases.  \\nAnd because this virus  mutates and spreads,  we have  to stay on guard. And here are four \\ncommonsense steps as we move  forward  safely,  in my view:  first, stay protected  with vaccines \\nand treatments. We know  how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you're vaccinated  and boosted,  \\nyou have  the highest  degree of protection, and we'll  never  give up on vaccinating  more  \\nAmericans.  Now,  I know  parents with kids under  5 are eager  to see their vaccines authorized  for \\ntheir children . Scientists  are working hard to get that done,  and we'll be ready  with plenty  of \\nvaccines if and when  they do. \\nWe're already —we are also ready  with antiviral treatments.  If you get COVID– 19, the Pfizer  \\npill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital  by 90 percent.  I've ordered  more  pills than \\nanyone  in the world  has. Pfizer  is working overtime  to get us a million  pills this month and more  \\nthan double  that\", 'next month.  And now we\\'re launching the \"Test  To Treat\"  initiative  so people  \\ncan get tested  at a pharmacy  and, if they prove  positive,  receive the antiviral pills on the spot at \\nno cost.  \\nAnd, f olks, if you\\'re immunocompromised or have  some  other  vulnerability, we have  \\ntreatments and free high-quality  masks.  We\\'re leaving  no one behind or ignoring  anyone \\'s needs  \\nas we move  forward.  On testing, we\\'ve made  hundreds  of millions  of tests available,  and you can \\norder  them  for free to your doorstep.  And we\\'ve already  ordered  free tests. If you already  ordered  \\nfree tests,  tonight  I\\'m announcing you can order  another  group  of tests. COVID —go to \\nCOVIDt ests.gov,  starting  next week,  and you can get more  tests.  \\nSecond,  we must  prepare for new variants.  Over  the past—we \\'ve gotten  much  better  at \\ndetecting  new variants. If necessary,  we\\'ll be able to develop  [deploy ]* new vaccines within  a \\nhundred days instead  of maybe  months  or', 'years. And if Congress presides [provides ]* the funds  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.', \"9 we need,  we'll have  new stockpiles of tests,  masks,  pills ready  if needed.  I can't promise  a new \\nvariant  won't come,  but I can promise  you we'll do everything  within  our power  to be ready  if it \\ndoes.  \\nThird, we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools  we need.  It's \\ntime for America  to get back  to work  and fill our great  downtowns  again  with people . People  \\nworking from  home  can feel safe and begin to return  to their offices.  \\nWe're doing that here in the Federal  Government . The vast majority  of Federal  workers will \\nonce  again  work  in person.  Our schools  are open. Let's keep  it that way. Our kids need  to be in \\nschool . With  75 percent  of adult  Americans fully  vaccinated  and hospitalizations  down by 77 \\npercent,  most  Americans can remove  their masks and stay in the classroom  and move  forward  \\nsafely.  \\nWe achieved  this because we provided free vaccines,  treatments,  tests,  and masks. Of \\ncourse,\", \"continuing  this costs  money,  so it will not surprise you I'll be back  to see you all. \\n[Laught er] And I'm going to soon send a request  to Congress.  The vast majority  of Americans  \\nhave  used these tools  and may want  again —we may need  them  again . So I expect  Congress —and  \\nI hope  you'll  pass that quickly.  \\nFourth,  we'll  continue  vaccinating  the world . We've sent 475 million  vaccine doses to 112 \\ncountries —more  than any nation  on Earth . We won't stop,  because you can't build a wall high \\nenough to keep  out a vaccine—the  vaccine can stop the spread  of these diseases.   \\nYou know,  we've  lost so much  in COVID– 19. Time  with one another . The worst  of all, the \\nloss of life. Let's use this moment  to reset . So stop looking at COVID as a partisan  dividing  line. \\nSee it for what  it is, a God-awful  disease.  Let's stop sending—seeing  each other  as enemies  and \\nstart seeing  each other  for who we are, fellow  Americans .  \\nLook, we can't change\", \"how divided we've been . That was a long time in coming . But we can \\nchange  how to move  forward  on COVID– 19 and other  issues that we must  face together.  \\nI recently  visited  New York  City Polic e Department  days after the funerals of Officer  \\nWilbert Mora  and his partner,  Officer  Jason  Rivera.  They  were responding to a 911 call when  a \\nman shot and killed  them  with a stolen  gun. Officer  Mora  was 27 years  old. Officer  Rivera  was \\n22 years old. Both  Dominican  Americans who grew up in the same streets that they later chose to \\nparol e—to patrol  as police  officers.  I spoke  with their families, and I told them  that we are \\nforever in debt for their sacrifices and we'll  carry  on their mission  to restore the trust and safety  in \\nevery  community  it deserves.  \\nLike some  of you that have  been  around for a while —I've  worked  with you on these issues \\nfor a long time. I know  what  works:  Investigating  [Investing in]* crime  prevention and\", \"community  policing : cops who walk  the beat,  who know  the neighborhood,  and who can restore \\ntrust and safety.   \\nLet's  not abandon our streets or choose  between  safety  and equal  justice . Let's come  together  \\nand protect  our communities,  restore trust, and hold law enforcement  accountable.  That's why the \\nJustice Department  has required  body  cameras,  banned chokeholds,  and restricted  no-knock \\nwarrants for its officers.  \\nThat's why the American  Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion  that cities, States,  \\nand counties  can use to hire more  police, invest  in more  proven strategies like community  \\nviolence  interruption, trusted  messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma  and giving \\nyoung people  some  hope.  We should all agree the answer  is not to defund the police.  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"10 Audience member.  That's  right!  \\nThe President.  It's to fund the police . Fund  them . Fund them . Fund them  with the resources \\nand training —resources and training  they need  to protect  our communities.  I ask Democrats and \\nRepublicans  alike  to pass my budget  and keep  our neighborhoods  safe. And we'll  do everything \\nin my power  to crack  down on gun trafficking  of ghost  guns  that you can buy online,  assemble  at \\nhome —no serial  numbers,  can't be traced.  I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun \\nviolence . Pass universal  background checks. Why should anyone  on the terrorist  list be able to \\npurchase a weapon . Why ? Why ?  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  And,  folks,  ban assault  weapons  with high-capacity  magazines that hold up to \\na hundred rounds . You think  the deer are wearing  Kevlar  vests? [Laughter ] Look,  repeal  the \\nliability  shield  that makes  gun manufacturers the only industry  in America  that can't be sued—the\", \"only one. Imagine  had we done  that with the tobacco  manufactur ers. These laws don't infringe  on \\nthe Second  Amendment , they save lives.  \\nThe most  fundamental  right  in America is the right  to vote and have  it counted. And look,  \\nit's under  assault.  In State after State, new laws have  been  passed  not only to suppress the vote—\\nwe've  been  there before —but  to subvert  the entire  election . We can't let this happen.  Tonight  I \\ncall on the Senate to pass the Freedom  To Vote act. Pass the John Lewis Act—Voting  Rights  Act. \\nAnd while  you're at it, pass the DISCLOSE Act so Americans know  who is funding our elections.  \\nLook,  tonight  I'd like to honor  someone  who has dedicated  his life to serve this country:  \\nJustice Breyer, an Army  veteran,  constitutional scholar,  retiring  Justice of the United  States  \\nSupreme  Court.  Justice Breyer,  thank you for your service. Thank you, thank  you, thank you. I \\nmean  it. Get up. Stand  and let them  see you.\", \"Thank you.  \\nAnd we all know —no matter  what  your ideology,  we all know  one of the most  serious  \\nconstitutional  responsibilities  a President  has is nominating  someone to serve on the United  States \\nSupreme  Court.  As I did 4 days ago, I've nominated a Circuit  Court  of Appeals— Ketanji  Brown  \\nJackson .  \\nOne of our Nation 's top legal  minds  who will continue  in Justice Breyer 's legacy  of \\nexcellence. A former top litigator  in private  practice,  a former Federal  public  defender  from  a \\nfamily  of public -school  educators and police  officers , she's a consensus  builder.  Since she's been  \\nnominated,  she's received  a broad range  of support,  including  the Fraternal  Order  of Police  and \\nformer judges  appointed by Democrats and Republicans.  \\nFolks, if we are to advance liberty  and justice,  we need  to secure our border  and fix the \\nimmigration  system .  \\nAudience members.  Build  the wall! Build  the wall! Build  the wall!  \\nThe President.  And as\", \"you might  guess,  I think  we can do both. At our border,  we've \\ninstalled  new technology,  like cutting -edge  scanners,  to better  detect  drug smuggling.  We've set \\nup joint patrols  with Mexico  and Guatemala to catch  more  human traffickers.  We're putting  in \\nplace dedicated  immigration  judges  in significant larger  number  so families  fleeing  persecution  \\nand violence  can have  their cases—cases heard  faster —and  those  who don't  [aren't ]* legitimately  \\nhere can be sent back.  \\nWe're screening —we' re securing  commitments  and supporting partners in South  and Central  \\nAmerica to host more  refugees and secure their own borders.  We can do all this while  keeping lit \\nthe torch  of liberty  that has led the generation  of immigrants  to this land, my forebearers and \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", '11 many  of yours.  Provide  a pathway  to citizenship  for \"dreamers,\" those  with temporary  status,  \\nfarmworkers,  essential  workers. To revise our laws so businesses have  workers they need  and \\nfamilies  don\\'t wait decades  to reunite.   \\nIt\\'s not only the right  thing  to do, it\\'s economically  smart  thing  to do. That\\'s why the \\nimmigration  reform  is supported by everyone  from  labor  unions  to religious  leaders to the U.S. \\nChamber  of Commerce . Let\\'s get it done  once  and for all.  \\nFolks, advancing liberty  and justice  also requires protecting  the rights  of women . The \\nconstitutional  right  affirmed  by Roe v. Wade , standing precedent  for half a century,  is under  \\nattack  as never  before.  If you want  to go forward  not backwards,  we must  protect  access to health  \\ncare,  preserve  a woman \\'s right  to choose,  and continue  to advance maternal  health  care for all \\nAmericans.  \\nAnd, folks,  for our LGBTQ+ Americans,  let\\'s finally  get the', \"bipartisan  Equality  Act to my \\ndesk. The onslaught  of State laws targeting  transgender  Americans and their families —it's simply  \\nwrong.  As I said last year,  especially  to our younger  transgender  Americans,  I'll always have  your \\nback  as your President  so you can be yourself  and reach  your God-given potential .  \\nFolks , as I've just demonstrated,  while  it often  appears we do not agree— [laughter ]—and  \\nthat—we do agree on a lot more  things  than we acknowledge.  I signed  80 bipartisan  bills into law \\nlast year,  from  preventing Government  shutdowns,  to protecting  Asian  Americans  from  still-too-\\ncommon  hate crimes,  to reforming  military  justice . And we'll soon be strengthening the Violence \\nAgainst  Women  Act that I first wrote three decades ago.  \\nAnd it's important —it's  important —for us to show  the Nation  that we can come  together  and \\ndo big things.  So tonight  I'm offering  a unity agenda  for the Nation:  four big things  we can do\", \"together,  in my view.  \\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic . There 's so much  we can do: increase  funding for prevention,  \\ntreatment,  harm  reduction,  and recovery;  get rid of outdated rules and stop doctors  and—that  stop \\ndoctors  from  prescribing  treatments;  stop the flow of illicit drugs  by working  with State and local  \\nlaw enforcement  to go after the traffickers . And if you're suffering  from  addiction,  you know —\\nyou should know  you're not alone . I believe in recovery,  and I celebrate the 23 million —23 \\nmillion  Americans in recovery .  \\nSecon d, let's take on mental  health —especially  among  our children,  whose lives  and \\neducation  have  been  turned  upside  down.  The American  Rescue Plan gave  schools  money  to hire \\nteacher s and help students  make  up for lost learning . I urge every  parent  to make  sure your school  \\ndoes just that. They  have  the money.  We can all play a part. Sign up to be a tutor  or a mentor . \\nChildren  were also\", \"struggling before  the pandemic:  bullying, violenc e, trauma,  and the harms  of \\nsocial  media.  \\nAs Frances Haugen,  who is here tonight  with us, has shown,  we must  hold social  media  \\nplatforms  accountable  for the national  experiment  they're conducting on our children  for profit . \\nFolks—[applause ]—thank  you. Thank you for the courage you showed.  It's time to strengthen  \\nprivacy  protections;  ban targeted  advertising  to children;  demand  tech companies stop collecting  \\npersonal  data on our children.  And let's get all Americans the mental  health  services they need . \\nMore people  can turn for help and full parity  between  physical  and mental  health  care if we treat \\nit that way in our insurance.  \\nLook,  the third  piece of that agenda  is support  our veterans. Veterans are the backbone  and \\nthe spine  of this country . They 're the best of us. I've always believed  that we have  a sacred  \\nobligation  to equip those  we send to war and care for those\", 'and their family  when  they come', \"12 home.  My administration  is providing assistance and job training  and housing and now helping \\nlower  income  veterans get VA care debt free. \\nAnd our troops  in Iraq have  faced —and Afghanistan —have  faced  many dangers. One being \\nstationed  at bases,  breathing in toxic  smoke  from  burn pits. Many  of you have  been  there. I've \\nbeen  in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan  over 40 times . These burn pits that incinerate waste —the \\nwastes of war, medical  and hazardous  materi al, jet fuel, and so much  more.  And they come  \\nhome —many  of the world 's fittest and best trained  warriors  in the world —never  the same:  \\nheadaches,  numbness,  dizziness,  a cancer  that would put them  in a flag-draped  coffin . I know.  \\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert . You put them  in. Thirteen  of them.  \\nAudience members.  Whoa!  \\nAudience members. Boo ! \\nThe President.  One of those —one  of those  soldiers was my son, Major  Beau  Biden . I don't \\nknow  for sure if the burn pit that he\", \"lived  near—that  his hooch was near in Iraq and, earlier  than \\nthat, in Kosovo  is the cause of his brain  cancer  and the disease of so many  other  troops . But I'm \\ncommitted  to find out everythi ng we can. \\nCommitted  to military  families like Danielle Robinson  from  Ohio,  the widow  of Sergeant  \\nFirst Class Heath  Robinson. He was born a soldier . Army  National  Guar d. Combat  medic  in \\nKosovo and Iraq. Stationed  near Baghdad,  just yards from  burn pits the size of football  fields.   \\nDanielle is here with us tonight . They  loved  going to Ohio  State  football  games . And he \\nloved building  Legos  with their daughter . But cancer  from  prolonged exposure  to burn pits \\nravaged  Heath 's lungs  and body.  Danielle says Heath  was a fighter  to the very end. He didn' t \\nknow  how to stop fighting,  and neither  did she. Through  her pain,  she found  purpose  to demand \\nthat we do better . Tonight, Danielle,  we are going to do better .  \\nThe VA is pioneering new\", \"ways of linking  toxic  exposures to disease,  already  helping more  \\nveterans get benefits. And tonight  I'm announcin g we're expanding eligibility  to veterans \\nsuffering  from  nine respiratory  cancers.  I'm also calling  on Congress  to pass a law to make  sure \\nveterans devastated  by toxic  exposure  in Iraq and Afghanistan  finally  get the benefits and the \\ncomprehensive health  care they deserve.  \\nAnd fourth  and last, let's end cancer  as we know  it. This is personal . This is personal  to me \\nand to Jill and to Kamala and so many  of you. So many  of you have  lost someone you love—\\nhusband,  wife,  son, daughter,  mom,  dad. Cancer  is the number -two cause of death  in America,  \\nsecond  only to heart  disease.   \\nLast month,  I announced the plan to supercharge the Cancer  Moonshot  that President  Obama \\nasked  me to lead 6 years ago. Our goal is to cut cancer  death  rates by at least 50 percent  over the \\nnext 25 years. And I think we can do bette r than that:\", \"turn cancers from  death  sentences into \\ntreatable diseases,  more  support  for patients and their families.  \\nTo get there,  I call on Congress to fund what  I called  ARPA– H: Advanced  Research  Projects  \\nAgency  for Health . Patterned  after DARPA  in the Defense Department,  projects that led—in \\nDARPA —to the internet,  GPS, and so much  more  that make  our Forces more —safer  and be able \\nto wage war more —with  more  clarity. ARPA [ARPA –H]* will have  a singular  purpose  to drive  \\nbreakthroughs  in cancer,  Alzheimer 's, and diabetes,  and more.  A unity agenda  for the Nation . We \\ncan do these things . It's within  our power . And I don't  see a partisan  edge  to any one of those  four \\nthings.  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"13 My fellow  Americans,  tonight  we've gathered  in a sacred  space:  the citadel  of democracy . In \\nthis Capitol, generation  after generation  of Americans  have  debated  great  questions  amid  great  \\nstrife  and have  done  great  things.  We fought  for freedom,  expanded liberty, debated  [defeated ]* \\ntotalitarianism  and terror. We built the strongest,  freest,  and most  prosperous  nation  the world  has \\never known.   \\nNow is the hour:  our moment  of responsibility, our test of resolve and conscience of history  \\nitself . It is in this moment  that our character  of this generation  is formed,  our purpose  is found,  \\nour future  is forged.  \\nWell, I know  this Nation . We'll  meet  the test, protect  freedom  and liberty, expand  fairness \\nand opportunity. And we will save democracy.  As hard as those  times  have  been,  I'm more  \\noptimistic  about  America today  than I've been  my whole  life because I see the future  that's  within  \\nour grasp,  because I know\", \"there is simply  nothing beyond our capacity.   \\nWe're  the only nation  on Earth  that has always turned every  crisis we've faced  into an \\nopportunity,  the only nation  that can be defined  by a single  word: possibilities.

Our organization has a clear focus and mission to enable improved business outcomes through advanced technology solutions and analytical expertise. The leadership team is comprised of seasoned healthcare industry experts focused on enabling the technological advancements necessary in today's ever-changing healthcare landscape. Strong foundations in technology systems and solutions and the business acumen to enable predictable business results are keys to our success. Experience, quality, and innovation are the cornerstones of our team's capabilities and are applied to each engagement.   EngageMate© is an HCP/HCO engagements tool developed by Cresen Solutions that enables our clients to fully track HCP and\", 'HCO  engagements throughout the entire life cycle. The system is designed to automate the business lifecycle of any fee for service engagement from business planning through close-out. It will also serve as the auditable system of record for all associated HCP/HCO fee-based contractual arrangements.  There are many problems to be solved in the engagement lifecycle, EngageMate shines in the way it solves these problems.     Below in figure 1 is a diagram of the entire lifecycle that is commonly utilized within the Life Sciences Industry when fee for service contractual services are required:', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\n Figure 1: HCP Engagement Lifecycle All life sciences companies hire health care professionals (HCPs), organizations (HCOs), and other service providers. Engaging a service provider is often a lengthy process with many moving pieces and interactions between departments. During that time, the Compliance department is attempting to keep track of, and approve, all activities and service providers to ensure compliance with external government regulations and internal company policies. The HCP engagement process involves workflow including fair market value (FMV) assessments and exceptions, activity concept reviews, nomination review and approvals, content review/approvals, monetary spend capture, and appropriate certification and activity close-out. As an added layer of complexity, the events can be held around the globe with service providers from many countries, all of whom need their own respective', \"cross-border workflows. While it is possible to track the engagement process via spreadsheets, word documents, and emails, this can be messy and error prone. In today's age of big data and required government reporting, the difficult task of manually tracking engagements is quickly becoming impossible. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have an easy-to-use system where a company can track and manage activities, approvals, and FMV tiers and rates all in one place.  EngageMate© is an elegant system that solves all the problems associated with the engagement lifecycle.  Recently, after an unsatisfactory experience with another engagement tool, a top pharmaceutical company returned to tracking their activities with emails, spreadsheets, and word documents. Cresen Solutions was then brought in to implement EngageMate©. After gathering business requirements around workflow requirements, business rules, and input forms EngageMate© was configured to meet all of the client’s policies and\", 'SOPs. EngageMate© was integrated with their customer', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nmaster to pull service provider information into the system, ensuring accurate Customer(HCP or HCO) details while limiting manual data entry. Review workflows were created for each region within the company enabling a smooth process for the activity to be reviewed by multiple departments and reviewers across the globe. After the workflows are completed EngageMate© assures proper closure and certification processes aligned with company policy. EngageMate© uses all the latest technologies and uses common open integration methodologies to enable easy interfacing with other company business systems.  From adding service providers to filling out forms and submitting activities, business users have enjoyed EngageMate’s© responsiveness and ease of use. Most users were able to pick up the navigation and use of the system after one self-guided training session. Everyone, both “Submitters” and “Reviewers”, receive', \"email notifications when an activity is ready for their action. The email provides an embedded hyperlink that takes users directly to the activity they need to take action on. Additionally, upon logging into EngageMate©, users are presented with a simple landing page showing tiles that separate activities into distinct categories allowing users to see a filtered list of activities to find any activity they are looking for expeditiously. It also includes customizable dashboards that pull information from the system in real-time to provide metrics for activities, service providers used, approvals, and close-out alerts.  Given the ever-changing nature of the life sciences industry and government reporting, flexibility is a top priority for all Cresen Solutions’ product offerings, including EngageMate©. It is easy to create and edit any of the system's forms and needs assessment qualifications from the user interface, including quickly changing language translations. In the most recent\", \"implementation of EngageMate©, the system is translated into Japanese, with the help of translation vendors and the users themselves. Cresen Solutions can accommodate changes or updates to the translations rapidly without downtime. Where EngageMate© shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented in the system without hardcoding and interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time.    Finally, any system must have flexibility in how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable.  This problem is compounded as the user pool grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. EngageMate© allows user profiles to be easily\", \"managed by an administrator to add and remove users, change their assigned department, grant access to specific forms, and change their role in the system. Reviewers, or the administrator on the Reviewer's behalf, can delegate their role to another Reviewer while out on leave.  This allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while they are out of the office.   In conclusion, EngageMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the engagement lifecycle. It allows for the management of the entire engagement process globally.

Our organization has a clear focus and mission to enable improved business outcomes through advanced technology solutions and analytical expertise. The leadership team is comprised of seasoned healthcare industry experts focused on enabling the technological advancements necessary in today's ever-changing healthcare landscape.

Experience, quality, and innovation are the cornerstones of our team's capabilities and are applied to each engagement.  Cresen Solutions developed MonitorMate© to enable our clients to easily assess global\", 'risk, create a calibrated monitoring plan, and track the execution of compliance monitoring and associated remedial events. The system is designed to automate the monitoring process of any company’s unique business need – from the risk assessment to the corrective action tracking for issues identified throughout the monitoring process. Additionally, the system has an automated workflow and email notification capability that eases the monitoring and remediation process of the company.    \\n Figure 1: Risk Monitoring Lifecycle.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nRisk management, auditing, and monitoring processes allow Life Science companies to conform with state and federal regulations while enabling them to also align with relevant internal policies and procedures. Within most companies, the global compliance department identifies potential risks through the execution of their ongoing monitoring process. Assessing the risk enables the organizations to identify weaknesses within the internal controls and identify policies and procedures that should be corrected. Companies can then take necessary corrective actions which ultimately can reduce the number of high-risk issues in the future. Additionally, the compliance department must monitor and document business events and interactions. Most companies lack flexibility and sophistication in identifying and mitigating their risk areas, monitoring, and auditing phases. The majority of these details are often tracked', 'through Excel sheets, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error. This manual tracking process becomes even more complex when the compliance teams are located across the globe in regions with varying international laws. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a refined system where companies can conduct a risk assessment, track monitoring, and remediation details, and easily assess the corrective measures. MonitorMate© is a refined system that seamlessly resolves many of the challenges associated within the risk monitoring lifecycle. Cresen Solutions prides itself on the satisfaction of our clients and the resulting associated improvements in business practices gained by switching from an outdated Excel-based approach to MonitorMate©. The system uses a simple question-based approach to evaluate global risk. The calculated risk value is then split into different ranges with corresponding colors which allows users to easily identify the activities with increased risk.', \"MonitorMate© supports single sign-on (SSO) and can also be integrated with different company source systems like an HR employee feed or a field-based sales roster Where MonitorMate© really shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented within the system without hardcoding and business interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a default value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time. MonitorMate© provides users with a comprehensive set of dashboards – accessible to all levels of the organization – to facilitate the real-time monitoring remediation and escalation of data captured within the system. For example, dynamic visuals such as heat maps are created with real-time data that helps the users to visualize\", '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ncolor-coded risk ratings to quickly identify risk severity. Dashboards, and sensitive or targeted information, can be aligned to different user roles created within the system, based on specific client requirements.  In many companies, compliance organizations can have large geographically dispersed structures with different roles and regions – within MonitorMate© we can customize the logic and associated dashboards to allow users restricted access to specific and relevant data for their regional and/or role assignments. Finally, any system must have the flexibility to support how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable. This problem is compounded as the user base grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. MonitorMate© allows user profiles to be easily managed by an administrator role.  Administrators can add', 'and remove users, limit the user to a specified region, change their assigned region, and change their role in the system. For example, a “monitor” role can assign an activity to multiple reviewers, which allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while a reviewer is out of the office. One of our recent clients had a specific business need that no other monitoring platform could effectively support. We developed a solution that catered to our client’s needs and allowed them to better capture their rep-ride monitoring data. This not only highlights MonitorMate’s© flexibility to accommodate specific business needs, but it ultimately resulted in a more sophisticated approach for capturing, analyzing, and identifying gaps in the field-based compliance monitoring process. In conclusion, MonitorMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the Risk Monitoring lifecycle. It is uniquely designed', 'to comprehensively assess, monitor, and evaluate global risk within a company.

SpendMate© is a healthcare compliance transparency tool designed to streamline the end-to-end business process of transparency reporting.\", 'Like other offerings in the Cresen Solutions suite, SpendMate© was created in partnership with our life sciences and pharmaceutical customers. SpendMate© enables companies to meet the growing demand for transparency between industry and medical providers in the form of report preparation, generation, and submission, doing so cost-effectively, and it also easily scales with companies as they expand globally. Transparency reporting has complex requirements, SpendMate© excels in the way it enables healthcare companies to efficiently navigate these requirements. All healthcare companies engage with medical professionals and organizations for various events and other engagements. Transactions from these interactions can include a service fee for speaking at an event, reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, and more. By law, or code, these transactions must be reported in each country where applicable and be made publicly available. Since the governing body can change based on', 'the country or region, the reporting requirements also differ. Another layer of complexity includes intricate business rules that are used to evaluate which transactions are reportable or not. While these reports can be created manually, doing so can prove error prone and time-consuming for compliance teams. When dealing with large numbers of transactions, manually determining which are to be reported is both inefficient and is generally considered poor business practice.  SpendMate© simplifies the spend reporting process by providing the flexibility and scalability needed by our clients to meet the compliance demands of external entities. Recently, SpendMate’s© reporting module was successfully implemented at a top 10 pharmaceutical company, providing greater control and configurability over their previous reporting solution. SpendMate© provides efficiency in form and function by having a user-friendly interface that is driven by a configurable business logic engine. This provides the', 'ability to add or remove attributes and business rules at any time without impacting legacy data. The key versatility of SpendMate© lies within its fully customizable forms and templates, allowing Cresen Solutions to', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ntailor the data entry forms and reporting templates to align with the needs of each client. Using SpendMate’s© end-to-end process, data can be imported from various engagement management systems, processed, validated, and reported using the built-in reporting module.  When operating on a global scale across different countries, users and user permissions must be managed effectively. User roles within SpendMate© are broken into 3 categories, Administrative, Data Coordinator, and Data Entry. Administrative accounts have access to all data and functionalities within SpendMate© and also have the ability to perform system administration and configuration. Data-Coordinators can create and edit transactions and submit them for verification as well as generate country-specific spend reports. To add a layer of data security, Data Coordinators can be assigned to specific countries and will only have access to the', 'assigned country’s data and reports. Lastly, the Data Entry role can be assigned to vendors giving them access to specific forms to enter transactions for commercial and research engagements. Users and their roles can be quickly set up or adjusted by the admins, ensuring a quick transition during times of employee turnover. Below in Figure 1 is an architecture diagram that showcases the different aspects of SpendMate©. \\n Figure 1: SpendMate© Architecture Diagram One key area in which SpendMate© excels is through its various activity management system integrations, allowing SpendMate© to receive a constant flow of data in relation to new events and other engagements between healthcare companies and medical professionals and organizations. The data received from these activity management systems is then cleaned and transformed before being displayed. To streamline the user’s access to SpendMate©, single sign-on integrations are supported but not required. Users can review and validate', 'the data within SpendMate© and use its built-in reporting module to generate spend reports specific to each country.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nTo ensure the accuracy of medical professional and organization customer records, SpendMate© has a partnership with Veeva Open Data and can integrate with other third-party vendors that maintain customer reference data to match the unique customer profiles. SpendMate© can be configured to send a request to a client’s customer master using an API call, and the returned match responses will be displayed for the user to select the matching customer profile. Additionally, SpendMate© supports automatic matching of the customer profiles if certain unique identifiers are present, such as the NPI number or other local identifiers. If duplicate customer profiles exist, SpendMate© has the added functionality of merging and unmerging customers to address these issues. One of the key features of SpendMate© is its reporting module, which supports the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations', '(EFPIA) reports, European Local Law reports, and U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports, Patient Organization (PO) reports, and other country specific reports (Brazil, Colombia, etc.). Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways. For that reason, SpendMate© allows our clients to determine which interactions are reportable and not reportable through business rules using mappings at the country and report type level. The same approach is applied to professional types, for example, a nurse might be reportable in Norway, but not in Switzerland, this can be easily handled through the mapping configurations of each country. For the purposes of validation, a validation file is automatically generated along with each report, following the same input parameters selected on the UI. Within the validation file are two key columns; if the transaction is included on the report and if not, the reason why it is excluded. The validation file can be used to quickly determine why certain transactions are missing from the disclosure report based on the reasoning provided. Users can also quickly adjust the mapping configurations to rectify the issue, if needed.', 'SpendMate’s© reporting module can also generate reports in different currencies and various numeric formats. SpendMate© offers users the choice of prepending or appending a currency code to the amount as per their requirements. The size of compliance teams can vary, therefore, SpendMate© allows for the saving of generated reports within the application. Saved reports can be accessed by everyone on the compliance team thereby reducing the need to constantly regenerate new reports. Reports from prior years can be maintained within the tool and are available for any updates or if a refreshed report is needed. Lastly, SpendMate© has an extensive audit trail capability that includes archiving/audit information on who generated which report, when it was generated, what the', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ninput parameters were, et cetera, allowing the compliance team to keep track of historical information and effectively respond to audit and exception inquires. In conclusion, SpendMate© is designed to simplify compliance transparency reporting on a global scale by supporting healthcare companies through every step of the process. SpendMate’s© ability to adapt paired with its flexibility allows our clients to thrive in the ever-changing landscape of compliance reporting.

And more than half of all the adults in \\nAmerica have gotten at least one shot.  \\nAt a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked the  nurse —I said, \"What\\'s it \\nlike?\" She looked at me , and she said, \"It\\'s like every shot is giving a dose of hope\" —was her \\nphrase. \"A dose of hope.\"  \\nA dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune \\ndisease —wrote to me, said she\\'s worried —that she was worrying about bringing the virus home. \\nShe said she then got vaccinated at a large site, i n her car. She said she sat in her car, when she \\ngot vaccinated and just cried , cried out of joy and cried out of relief.  \\nParents seeing  the smiles on their kids\\' faces, for those who are able to go back to school \\nbecause the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.  \\nGrandparents', \"hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a \\nwindow to say goodbye.  It means everything. Those things mean e verything.  \\nYou know, there's still —you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans —\\nthere's still more work to do to beat this virus. We can't let our guard down.  \\nBut tonig ht I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past \\nhundred days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical \\nachievements —logistical achievements —this country has ever seen.  \\nWhat else have we done in those first hundred days?  \\nWe kept our commitment —Democrats and Republicans—of sending $1,400 rescue checks \\nto 85 percent of American households. We've already sent more than 160 million checks out the \\ndoor. It's making the difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people, it's making all the difference in the world.  \\nThe single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said\", \"she couldn't work, but she said the relief \\ncheck put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment.  A \\ngrandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor , \\nsomething she said she put off for months because she didn't have the money.  \\nOne of the  defining images, at least from my perspective, in  this crisis has been cars lined \\nup, cars lined up for miles. And not people who just barely ever start those cars, nice cars lined up \\nfor miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.  I don't know about you, but I didn't \\never think I'd see that in America. And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their \\nown, these people are in this position.  \\nThat's why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of \\nAmericans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.  We're also providing rental \\nassistance—you all know this, but the American people, I want\", \"to make sure they understand —\\nkeeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.  \\nDuring these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act \\nwhen I established the special signup period to do that —800,000 in that period.  We're making \\none of the largest one -time ever investments—ever —in improving health care for veterans. \\nCritical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we're on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.  \\nAnd, in the process, while this was all go ing on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 \\nnew jobs in 100 days , more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.  The\", '3 International Monetary Fund is now estimating our  economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 \\npercent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four \\ndecades.  \\nAmerica is moving —moving forward—but we can\\'t stop now.  We\\'re in competition with \\nChina and other countries to win the 21st c entury. We\\'re at a great inflection point in history. We \\nhave to do more than just build back better —I mean , \"build back.\" We have to build back better. \\nWe have to compete more strenuous ly than we have.  \\nThroughout our history, if you think about it, public investment i n infrastructure has literally \\ntransformed America: our attitudes, as well as our opportunities.  The transconti nental railroad, \\nthe interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United \\nStates of America.  Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of \\nopportunity.  Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon—now we\\'re', \"on Mars—discovering \\nvaccines,  gave us the i nternet , and so much more.  \\nThese are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the \\nGovernment was in a position to make. Time and again, they propel us into the future.  That's why \\nI proposed the American Jobs Plan , a once-in -a-generation investment in America itself. This is \\nthe largest jobs plan since World War  II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation \\ninfrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, \\nrail corridors, transit lines. \\nIt's clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 \\nschools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water , a clear \\nand present danger to our children's health.  \\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the N ation's lead pipes and \\nservice lines so every American can drink clean water. And , in the process, it will create\", \"thousands an d thousands of good- paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with \\nhigh-speed internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn't have it.  This is \\ngoing t o help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st -century economy.  \\nAnd I 'm asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would ——  \\nVice President Kamala D. Harris. Of course.  \\nThe President.  ——because I know it will get done.  \\nIt creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, \\ncatastrophic failures, with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter \\nstorms.  The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission \\nlines needed to build a re silient and fully clean grid. We can do that.  \\nLook, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to \\ntheir careers.  Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic —2\", \"million , and too often bec ause they couldn't get the care they needed to care for their child or care \\nfor an elderly parent who needs help.  \\nEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to g et homecare \\nfor their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it's not important, check out in \\nyour own district , Democrat or Republican. Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern —\\nalmost as much as their children —is taking care o f an elderly loved one who can't be left alone. \\nMedicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our \\ncaregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.\", '4 For too long, we\\'ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the \\nclimate crisis: \"jobs.\" Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think \"climate change,\" I think \"jobs.\"  \\nThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more \\nenergy -efficient buildings and homes ; electrical workers—IBEW members —installing 500,000 \\ncharging stations along our highways so we can own the electric car market. Farmers —farmers \\nplanting cover cr ops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.  \\nLook, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can\\'t be \\nbuilt in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None. No reason. So, folks, there\\'s no reason \\nwhy American workers can\\'t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I \\nmean, there is no reason. We have this capacit y. We have the brightest, best  trained people in the \\nworld.  \\nThe American Jobs Plan is going to', 'create millions of good-paying jobs —jobs Americans \\ncan raise a family on —as my dad would t hen say, \"with a little breathing room.\"  And all the \\ninvestments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: b uy American. Buy \\nAmerican.  And I might note, parenthetically , that does not violate any trade agreement. It\\'s been \\nthe law since the thirties : buy American.  \\nAmerican tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in Americ a to \\ncreate American jobs. That\\'s the way it\\'s supposed to be and it will be in this administration. And \\nI made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been strenuously \\nlimited. It will be American products. \\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of \\nyou—so many of the folks I grew up with—feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that\\'s so \\nrapidly changing i t\\'s frightening.  I want to speak directly to you. Because if you think about it,', 'that\\'s what people are most worried about: \"Can I fit in?\"  \\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions \\nof dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is an 8 -year program. These are good -\\npaying jobs that can\\'t be outsourced.  \\nNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require \\na college degree; 75 percent don\\'t require an associate\\'s degree.  The American Jobs Plan is a blue-\\ncollar blueprint to build America. That\\'s what it is.  \\nAnd it recognizes something I\\'v e always said in this Chamber and the other. Good guys and \\nwomen on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn\\'t build this country. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. So that\\'s why I\\'m calling on Congress to pass the \\nProtect the Right to Organize Act —the PRO Act —and send it to my desk so we can support the \\nright to unionize.  \\nAnd by the way, while you\\'re thinking about sending things to my', \"desk—[ laughter ]—let's \\nraise the minimum wage to $15. No one —no one working 40 hours a week—no one working 40 \\nhours a week should live below  the poverty line.  \\nWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. And while we're doing this, \\nlet's get the Paych eck Fairness Act to my desk as well —equal pay. It's been much too long. And \\nif you're wondering whether it's too long, look behind me.  \\nAnd finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and \\ndevelopment on record. We will see more technological change— and some of you know more \\nabout this than I do—we'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the \\nlast 50. That's how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.\", \"5 And we're falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.  Decades ago, we used to \\ninvest 2 pe rcent of our gross domestic product in America —2 percent of our gross domestic \\nproduct —in research and development.  \\nToday, Mr. Secretary, that's less than 1 percent. Ch ina and other countries are closing in fast. \\nWe have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, \\nbiotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.  \\nThe Secretary of Defense can tell you —and those of you on—who work on national security \\nissues know—the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA—the Defense Advanced \\nResearch Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here —and that's been a long time \\nago—to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security—that's their only job. And it's \\na semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the \\ndiscovery of the internet  to GPS and so much more that 's enhanced\", \"our security.  \\nThe National Institute of Health —the NIH—I believe, should create a similar Advanced \\nResearch Projects Agency for Health. And that would —here's what it would do. It would have a \\nsingular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer's, \\ndiabetes, and cancer.  \\nI'll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President —\\nalmost $9 million going to NIH. And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I'll ne ver \\nforget you standing , Mitch, and saying you'd name it after my deceased son. It meant a lot.  \\nBut so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who di ed of cancer. I can \\nthink of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. So let's end cancer \\nas we know it. It's within our power. It's within our power to do it.  \\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we're talking about, have often had \\nbipartisan support in the past. Vice\", \"President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with \\nDemocrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican \\nSenators who just put forward their own proposal.  \\nSo let's get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the \\ndeep discussions. I'd like to meet with those who have ideas that are different —they think are \\nbetter. I welcome those ideas.  \\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, \\ndoing nothing is not an option. Look, we can't be so busy competing with one another that we \\nforget the competition  that we have with the rest of the world to win t he 21st century.  \\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi: traveled over 17,000 \\nmiles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called \\nto congratulate me, we had a 2 -hour discussion. He's deadly earnest about becoming the most\", \"significant, consequential nation in the world. He and others —autoc rats—think that democracy \\ncan't compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.  \\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once -in-a-\\ngeneration investment in our families and our children. That's why I've introduced the American \\nFamilies Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.  \\nFirst is access to a good education. When this N ation made 12 years of public education \\nuniversal in the last century, it made us the best  educated, best  prepared Nation in the world. It's, I \\nbelieve, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st —in the 20th \\ncentury.\", '6 But the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, \\nparenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, \"Okay, \\nwe\\'re going to deci de what we do in terms of g overnment providing for free education,\" I wonder \\nwhether we\\'d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I \\ndoubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st \\ncentury.  That\\'s why my American Families Plan guarantees 4  additional years of public education \\nfor every person in America, starting as early as we can.  \\nThe great universiti es of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows \\nthat adding 2 years of universal high -quality preschool for every 3 -year -old and 4 -year-old, no \\nmatter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the \\nway through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of', 'graduating and going on \\nbeyond graduation.  The research shows when a young child goes to school —not daycare—they \\nare far mor e likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.  \\nWhen you add 2 years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the \\ndynami c. We can do that.  \\nAnd we\\'ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, \\nTribal Colleges, Minority -Serving Institutions. The reason is: They don\\'t have the endowments, \\nbut their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy —all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.  \\nJill is a community co llege professor who teaches today as First Lady. She\\' s long said —if \\nI\\'ve heard it once, I\\'ve heard it a thousand times: \"Joe, any country that outeducates us is going to \\noutcompete us.\" She\\'ll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill.', \"Second thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable \\nchildcare. We guarantee—and I'm proposing a legislation to guarantee that low - and middle -\\nincome families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children \\nup to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime.  \\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally pr ovide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and \\nmedical leave —family and medical leave. We're one of the few industrial countries in the world . \\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their \\nloved ones —a parent, a spouse, or child.  \\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of \\nAmericans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for ever y child in a family. Up to $3,000 per \\nchild, if they're under 6  years of age—I mean, excuse me—under —over [under ]\\n* 6 years of age, \\nand $3,600 for\", \"children over 6  years of age.  \\nWith two parents, two kids, that's $7,200 in the pockets that's going to help to take care of \\nyour family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child ]* \\npoverty in half. And we can afford it.  So we did that in the last piece of legislation we passed. But \\nlet's extend that c hildcare tax credit at least through the end of 2025.  \\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered health  care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy \\ntheir coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that's really popular on this side of the \\naisle. [Laughter ] But let's make that provision permanent so their premiums don't go back up.  \\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I'm going to work with Congress to address, this year, other \\ncritical priorities for American families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"7 of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women's health. And the \\npandemic has demonstrated how badly —how badly—it's needed. Let's lower deductibles for \\nworking families on the Affordable Care —in the Affordable Care Act. And let's lower \\nprescription drug costs.  \\nWe know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how \\noutrageously expensive drugs are in America.  In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices \\nof anywhere in the world right here in America —nearly three times —for the same drug, nearly \\nthree times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can.  \\nLet's do what we've always talked about for all the years I was down here in this body —in \\nCongress. Let's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. And by the way, i t won't just help people on Medicare,  it will \\nlower prescription drug costs for everyone.  \\nAnd the\", \"money we save, which is bill ions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable \\nCare Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. \\nIt's within our power to do it; let's do it now. We've talked about it long enough. Democrats and \\nRepublicans , let's get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health  care should be a \\nright  and not a privilege in America.  \\nSo how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without \\nincreasing the deficits. Let's start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on \\npeople making less than $400,000. It's —but it's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 \\npercent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair shar e. Just their fair share.  \\nSometimes , I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be \\nable to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.  \\nA recent study shows that 55 of the\", \"nation's biggest corporations paid zero Federal tax last \\nyear. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade \\ntaxes through ta x havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit \\nfrom tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It's not right.  \\nWe're going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pa y for the public \\ninvestments their businesses will benefit from as well. And w e're going to reward work, not just \\nwealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans— those making \\nover $400,000 or more —back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he \\nstarted: 39.6 percent. That's where it was when George W. was President.  \\nWe're going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million \\ndollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a\", 'paycheck. We\\'re only going to affect three -tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by tha t action —\\nthree-tenths of 1 percent.  And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires \\nwho cheat on their taxes. It\\'s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that ar e left, right, \\nand center.  \\nI\\'m not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden—additional tax burden to \\nthe middle class in this country. They\\'re already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair , \\nfiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.  \\nWhen you hear someone say that they don\\'t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or \\ncorporate America, ask them: \"Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to \\ncut?\"', '8 Look, the big tax cut of 2017, remember, it was supposed to pay for itself —that was how it \\nwas sold —and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a \\nhuge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.  \\nInstead of using the tax saving to rai se wages and invest in research and development, it \\npoured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their \\nworkers is now among the largest in history.  According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what \\nthe average w orker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the —below a hundred.  \\nThe pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the \\npandemic : working and middle  class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in \\nAmerica saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion , in the same exact period. Let me \\nsay it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during', 'this pande mic. And \\nthey\\'re now worth more than $4 trillion.  \\nMy fellow Americans, trickle-down—trickle -down—economics has never worked , and it\\'s \\ntime to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. Yo u know, there\\'s a broad \\nconsensus of economists— left, right, center —and they agree what I\\'m proposing will help create \\nmillions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest  value \\ninvestments we can make as a Nation. \\nI\\'ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our \\npower.  In my conversations with world leaders— and I\\'ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now —\\nI\\'ve made it known—I\\'ve made it known—that America is back. And you know what they say? \\nThe comment that I hear most of all from them is they say : \"We see America is back , but for how \\nlong? But for how long?\"  \\nMy fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we\\'re back, but that we\\'re back to stay \\nand that we aren\\'t going to go it', \"alone. We're going to do it by leading with our allies. No one \\nnation can deal with all the crises of our time—from te rrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass \\nmigration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well  as experi encing —what we're experiencing now \\nwith pandemics.  \\nThere's no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply , as it grows \\nto meet our nee ds—and we're meeting them —will become an arsenal f or vaccines for other \\ncountries, just as America was the ars enal of democracy for the world  and, in consequence, \\ninfluenced the world.  \\nBut every American will have access before that occur s—every American will have acce ss \\nto be fully covered by COVID– 19 from the vaccines we have.  \\nLook, the climate crisis is not our fight alone , it's a global fi ght. The United States accounts, \\nas all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for \\n85 percent. That's why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris accord\", \"—because if we do \\neverything perfectly, it's not going to ultimately matter. \\nI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the \\nmajor economies of the world—China, Russia, India, the European Union—and I said I'd do it in \\nmy firs t hundred days.  \\nI want to be very blunt about it: I had— my attempt was to make sure that the world could \\nsee there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensus—the \\nconsensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth \\nand opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world.  If you've \\nwatched any of it —and you were all busy; I'm sure you didn't have much time —that's what \\nvirtually every nation said, even the ones that aren't doing their fair share.\", '9 The investments I\\'ve proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that \\nbenefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the \\nglobal economy, including China.  \\nMy discussions—in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, \"We welcome the \\ncompetition. We\\'re not looking for conflict.\" But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America\\'s interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state—to state -owned operations \\nand enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.  \\nI also told President Xi that we\\'ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo -Pacific, just \\nas we do with NATO in Europe, not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. I told him what I\\'ve \\nsaid to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments—our commitment to human rights and fundamental', \"freedoms and to our alliances.  \\nAnd I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic \\nhuman rights are being so blatantly violated. An American President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea, the most unique idea in history: We are \\ncreated, all of us, equal. It's who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we're dealing with the American idea.  \\nWith regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I  made very clear to Putin th at \\nwe're not going to seek—excuse me —escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they \\nturn out to be true. And they turned out to be true , so I responded directly and proportionally to \\nRussia's interference in our elections and the cyber  attacks on our G overnment and our business. \\nThey did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.  \\nBut we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interest. We did\", \"it when we extended the \\nNew START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we're working to do it on climate change. But he \\nunderstands we will  respond.  \\nOn Iran and North Korea—nuclear programs that present serious threats to American \\nsecurity and the security of the world —we're going to be working closely with our allies to \\naddress the threats posed by bot h of these countries through diplomacy, as well as stern \\ndeterrence.  \\nAnd American leadership means ending the fore ver war in Afghanistan. We have, without \\nhyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a war  zone.  Today , we have servicemembers \\nserving in the same war  zone as their parents did. We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who \\nwere not yet born on 9/11.  \\nThe war in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be \\nmultigenerational undert akings of nation -building. We went to Afghanistan to\", \"get terrorists —the \\nterrorists who attacked us on 9/11 —and we said we would follow Usama bin Laden to the gates \\nof hell to do it. If you've been to the upper Kunar Valley, you've kind of seen the gates of hell. \\nAnd we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of A l Qai da in \\nAfghanistan. And after 20 years of value—valor and sacrifice, it's time to bring those troops \\nhome.  \\nLook, even as we do, we will maintain an over -the-horizon capacity to suppress future \\nthreats to the homeland. And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has—terrorism has metastasized. The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan. And those of you in the \\nintelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al\", '10 Qaida and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and \\nbeyond.  \\nAnd we won\\'t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal \\nterrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism. We\\'re not going to ignore \\nthat either. \\nMy fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this N ation . It was \\nnearly a year ago, before her father\\'s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd\\'s young daughter. She\\'s a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the \\neye. And she looked at  me and she said, \"My daddy changed the world.\" Well, after the \\nconviction of George Floyd\\'s murderer, we can see how right she was if we have the courage to \\nact as a Congress.  \\nWe\\'ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans. Now is our opportunity \\nto make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our', \"communities, and they serve them honorably.  I know them. I know they want to \\nhelp meet this moment as well.  \\nMy fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement \\nand the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact \\npolice reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already.  I know Republicans have \\ntheir own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate. We need to work together to find a consensus. But let's get it done next month, by the first \\nanniversary of George Floyd's death.  \\nThe country supports this reform, and Congress should act —should act. We have a giant \\nopportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice —real justice. And with the \\nplans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America \\nand American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity —good jobs, good schools,\", \"affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two \\ngenerations because you have an access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of \\nmore Americans: Black, White, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.  \\nLook, I also want to thank the United States Senate for v oting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID –19 \\nHate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. You acted decisively. And \\nyou can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we've seen over the past year —this \\npast year and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, \\nwhich I will gladly, anxiously sign.  \\nI also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans. To \\nall transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want \\nyou to know your President has your back.  \\nAnother thing: Let's authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law\", 'for 27 \\nyears. Twenty -seven years ago, I wrote it. It  will close the —the act that has to be authori zed now \\nwill close the \"boyfriend\" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said:  \\n\"This is an abuser. You can\\'t own a gun.\" It\\'s to close that loophole that existed.  You know, it\\'s \\nestimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America— 50 \\na month. Let\\'s pass it and save some lives.  \\nAnd I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.  The \\nflag at the White House was still flying at half -mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in \\nGeorgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.  And, in the week in', '11 between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 \\nshot dead.  \\nI know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the ninetie s, we passed universal \\nbackground checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds \\nthat can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. \\nCheck out the report over  10 years. But  in the early twenty —2000s, the law expired, and we\\'ve \\nseen daily bloodshed since. I\\'m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn\\'t see bloodshed.  \\nMore than 2  weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I \\nknow —the survivors and f amilies who lost loved ones to gun violence —I laid out several  of the \\nDepartment of Justice actions that are being taken to  impact on this epidemic.  \\nOne of them is banning so- called \"ghost guns.\" The se are homemade guns built from a kit \\nthat includes directions on how to finish the firearm. The', \"parts have no serial numbers, so they \\nshow up at crime scenes,  and they can't be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren't \\nrequired to pass any background check. Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit \\nand, within 30 minutes , have a weapon that's lethal. But no more.  \\nAnd I will do everything in my power to protect the American peop le from this epidemic of \\ngun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational , but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of \\nDemocrat ic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of \\nguns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't \\nbe done. We did it before, and it worked.  \\nTalk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They'll tell you there's no possible \\njustification for having 100 rounds in a weapon. What do you think: deer are wearing Kevlar \\nvests? [Laughter\", '] No, what\\'s —they\\'ll tell you that there are too many people today who are able \\nto buy a gun,  but shouldn\\'t be able to buy a gun.  \\nThese kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, \\nincluding many gun owners. The country supports reform and is —and Congress should act.  \\nThis shouldn\\'t be a red or blue issue. An d no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You \\ncan\\'t yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater. From the very beginning, there were certain guns, \\nweapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons \\never.  We\\'re not changing the Constitution; we\\'re being reasonable. I think this is not a Democrat \\nor Republican issue , I think it\\'s an American issue.  \\nAnd here\\'s what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to Amer ica. Let\\'s \\nend our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we\\'ve done nothing about it. It\\'s time to fix', \"it.  \\nOn day one of my P residency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration \\nbill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for  high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it \\nso over 11 million undocumented folks —the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We \\ncan actually —if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to —so take a close look at \\nit. \\nWe have to —also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to —\\nto our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, \\nthe gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.  \\nWhen I was President, my President —when I was Vice President, the President asked me to \\nfocus on provi ding the help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep\", '12 people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last \\nadministration decided it was not worth it. I\\'m restoring the program and as ked Vice President \\nHarris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this. I have absolute confidence she\\'ll get the job done.  \\nNow, look, if you don\\'t like my plan, le t\\'s at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs \\nto pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for \"dream ers,\" the young peopl e who \\nhave only known America as their home. And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural -made —\\nviolence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our \\ntables.  \\nLook, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our \\nhistory. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let\\'s argue over it, let\\'s debate \\nit, but let\\'s', \"act.  \\nAnd if we truly want to restore the soul of America,  we need to protect the sacred right to \\nvote. Most people —more people voted in the last P residential election than any time in American \\nhistory, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebra ted. Instead, it's being \\nattacked.  Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my \\ndesk right away. The country supports it. The Congress should act now.   \\nLook, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this \\nCapitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds.  Lives were put at risk —many \\nof your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrecti on was an \\nexistential crisis, a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did.  \\nBut the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is \\nboth ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic , still vital today. Can our\", \"democracy deliver on its \\npromise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?  Can our de mocracy deliver the most —to the most pressing needs of our \\npeople?  Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart? \\nAmerica's adversaries —the autocrats of the world —are betting we can't. And I promise you, \\nthey're bett ing we can't. They believe we're too full of anger and division and rage.  They look at \\nthe images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. But they are wrong. You know it; I know it. But we have to prove them wrong.  \\nWe have to prove democracy still works , that our G overnment still works and we can deliver \\nfor our people.  In our first hundred days together, we've acted to r estore the people's faith in \\ndemocracy to deliver. We're vaccinating the N ation. We're creating hundreds of thousands of new \\njobs.\", 'We\\'re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.  \\nOpening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice, that\\'s the \\nessence of America. That\\'s democracy in action.  Our Constitution opens with the words —as trite \\nas it sounds —\"We the People\". Well, it\\'s time to remember that \"We the People\" are the \\nGovernment —you and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we \\nhave no control over. It\\'s us. It\\'s \"We the People.\"  \\nIn another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, \"In \\nAmerica, we do our part.\" We all do our part. That\\'s a ll I\\'m asking: that we do our part, all of us. \\nIf we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will. And the future belongs to \\nAmerica.', '13 As I st and here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our \\nNation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic \\nabout America , not because I\\'m President, because what\\'s happening with the American people.  \\nWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and \"We \\nthe People\" did not flinch.  At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart \\nand fail, we came together. We united.  With light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new \\nresolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more \\nperfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one  Nation, and one America.  \\nFolks, as I told every world leader I\\'ve ever met with over the years, it\\'s never ever, ever \\nbeen a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn\\'t.  \\nWe are the United States of America. There is not a single thing —nothing—not hing beyond \\nour', \"capacity. We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together. So let's begin to get together.  \\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience.  \\nN\\nOTE: The President spoke at 9:0 6 p.m. in the House C hamber of the U.S. Capitol. In his \\nremarks, he referred to Se nate Minority Leader  A.

Thank you so much. \\nMadam  Speaker,  Madam Vice President, and our First Lady  and Second  Gentleman,  Members  of \\nCongress  and the Cabinet,  Justices of the Supreme  Court,  my fellow  Americans:  Last year,  \\nCOVID– 19 kept us apart . This year,  we're finally  together  again.   \\nTonight  we meet  as Democrats,  Republicans,  and Independents,  but most  importantly, as \\nAmericans with a duty to one another , to America,  to the American  people,  and to the \\nConstitution, and an unwavering  resolve that freedom  will always triumph  over tyranny.  \\nSix—[applause ]—thank you. Six days ago, Russia's  Vladimir  Putin  sought  to shake  the very \\nfoundations  of the free world,  thinking he could make  it bend to his menacing  ways. But he badly  \\nmiscalculated . He thought  he\", 'could roll into Ukrain e and the world  would roll over. Instead,  he \\nmet with a wall of strength  he never  anticipated  or imagined . He met the Ukrainian  people .  \\nFrom  President Zelensk iy, their —to every  Ukrainian,  their fearlessness,  their courage,  their \\ndetermination  literally  inspires  the world . Groups  of citizens blocking tanks  with their bodies . \\nEveryone  from  students  to retirees,  to teachers turned soldiers defending  their homeland.  And in \\nthis struggle —President  Zelensk iy said in his speech  to the European  Parliament, \"Light will win \\nover darkness. \" \\nThe Ukrainian  Amba ssador  to the United  States  is here tonight  sitting  with the First Lady . \\nLet each of us, if you\\'re able to stand,  stand  and send an unmistakable  signal  to the world  and \\nUkraine. Thank you. Thank  you, thank  you, thank you. She\\'s bright, she\\'s strong,  and she\\'s \\nresolved . Yes. We, the United  States  of America,  stand  with the Ukrainian  people.  \\nThroughout', \"our history,  we've learned  this lesson:  When  dictators  do not pay a price  for their \\naggression,  they cause more  chaos;  they keep  moving;  and the costs,  the threats to the America—\\nand America,  to the world  keeps rising. That's why the NATO alliance  was created:  to secure \\npeace and stability  in Europe  after World  War II. The United  States is a member,  along with 29 \\nother  nations . It matters. American  diplomacy  matters . American  resolve  matters.  \\nPutin 's latest  attack  on Ukraine was premeditated  and totally  unprovoked. He rejected  \\nrepeated —repeated —efforts  at diplomacy.  He thought  the West and NATO wouldn' t respond . He \\nthought  he could  divide  us at home,  in this Chamber,  in this Nation . He thought  he could divide  \\nus in Europe  as well.   \\nBut Putin  was wrong. We are ready . We are united . And that's what  we did: We stayed  \\nunited.  We prepared  extensively  and carefully . We spent  months  building  coalitions  of other\", \"freedom -loving nations  in Europe  and the Americas to—from  America to the Asian  and African  \\ncontinents  to confront  Putin.  \\nLike many  of you, I spent  countless hours  unifying  our European allies. We shared  with the \\nworld  in advance  what  we knew  Putin  was planning and precisely  how he would try to falsif y and \\njustify  his aggression.  We countered  Russia 's lies with the truth . And now—now  that he's acted,  \\nthe free world  is holding him accountable,  along with 27 members  of the European  Union—\\nincluding  France,  Germany,  Italy—as well as countries  like the United  Kingdom,  Canada,  Japan,  \\nKorea,  Australia,  New Zealand,  and many  others —even Switzerland —are inflicting  pain on \\nRussia and supporting the people  of Ukraine.  Putin  is now isolated  from  the world  more  than he \\nhas ever been.\", \"2 Together,  along  with our allies,  we are right  now enforcing  powerful  economic  sanctions . \\nWe're cutting  off Russia's  largest  banks  from  the international financial  system;  preventing \\nRussia 's Central Bank  from  defending the Russian  ruble,  making Putin 's $630 billion  war fund \\nworthless. We're choking Russia 's access to technology  that will sap its economic  strength  and \\nweaken  its military  for years to come.  \\nTonight  I say to the Russian  oligarchs  and the corrupt  leaders who have bilked  billions  of \\ndollars  off this violent  regime:  No more . The United  States— [applause ]—I mean  it. The United  \\nStates  Department  of Justice is assembling  a dedicated  task force  to go after the crimes  of the \\nRussian  oligarch s. \\nWe're joining  with European allies to find and seize their yachts,  their luxury apartments,  \\ntheir private  jets. We're coming  for your ill-begotten gains.  And tonight  I'm announcing  that we \\nwill join our allies in\", \"closing  off American  air space to all Russian  flights, further isolating  Russia \\nand adding an additional squeeze on their economy .  \\nHe has no idea what 's coming.  The ruble  has already  lost 30 percent  of its value,  the Russian  \\nstock  marke t has lost 40 percent  of its value,  and trading remains suspended.  The Russian  \\neconomy  is reeling,  and Putin  alone  is the one to blame.  \\nTogether  with our allies, we're providing support  to the Ukrainians in their fight  for freedom:  \\nmilitary  assistance,  economic  assistance,  humanitarian  assistance. We're giving  more  than a \\nbillion  dollars  in direct  assistance to Ukraine. And we'll continue  to aid the Ukrainian  people  as \\nthey defend  their country  and help ease their suffering .  \\nBut let me be clear:  Our Forces are not engaged  and will not engage in the conflict with \\nRussian  forces  in Ukraine. Our Forces are not going to Europe  to fight  [in]* Ukraine but to defend  \\nour NATO allies in the event\", \"that Putin  decides to keep  moving west.  For that purpose,  we have  \\nmobilized  American  ground forces,  air squadrons , ship deployments  to protect  NATO countries,  \\nincluding  Poland,  Romania,  Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. And as I've made  crystal  clear,  the \\nUnited  States  and our allies will defend  every  inch of territory  that is NATO territory  with the full \\nforce  of our collective  power —every  single  inch.  \\nAnd we're clear  eyed . The Ukrainians are fighting  back  with pure courage . But the next few \\ndays,  weeks,  and months  will be hard on them.  Putin has unleashed  violence  and chaos. But while  \\nhe may make  gains  on the battlefield, he'll pay a continuing high price  over the long run. And a \\npound of Ukrainian  people —the  proud,  proud people —pound  for pound,  ready  to fight  with \\nevery  inch of energy they have . They 've known 30 years  of independence —have  repeatedly  \\nshown  that they will not tolerate  anyone  who tries to take\", \"their country  backwards.  \\nTo all Americans,  I'll be honest  with you, as I've always promised  I would be. A Russian  \\ndictator  invading a foreign  country  has costs around the world . And I'm taking  robust  action  to \\nmake  sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted  at Russian  economy  and that we use every  tool at \\nour disposal  to protect  American  businesses and consumers.   \\nTonight  I can announce  the United  States  has worked  with 30 other  countries  to release 60 \\nmillion  barrels of oil from  reserves around the world . America will lead that effort,  releasing  30 \\nmillion  barrels of our own Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve. And we stand  ready  to do more  if \\nnecessary,  united  with our allies.  \\nThese steps will help blunt  gas prices here at home . But I know  news about  what 's \\nhappening  can seem  alarming  to all Americans. But I want  you to know:  We're going  to be okay . \\nWe're going to be okay.  \\n                                                 \\n*\", 'White House correction.', \"3 When  the history  of this era is written, Putin 's war on Ukraine will have  left Russia weaker  \\nand the rest of the world  stronger .  \\nWhile  it shouldn' t have  taken  something so terrible  for people  around the world  to see what 's \\nat stake,  now everyone sees it clearly.  We see the unity  among leaders of nations,  a more  unified  \\nEurope,  a more  unified  West.  We see unity  among the people  who are gathering in cities  in large \\ncrowds around the world,  even  in Russia,  to demonstrate their support  for the people  of Ukraine.   \\nIn the battle  between  democracy  and autocracies,  democracies are rising  to the moment , and \\nthe world  is clearly  choosing the side of peace and security.  This is the real test, and it's going  to \\ntake time. So let us continue  to draw inspiration  from  the iron will of the Ukrainian  people.  \\nTo our fellow  Ukrainian  Americans who forged  a deep  bond that connects  our two nations:  \\nWe stand  with you. We stand  with you.\", \"Putin  may circle Kiev with tanks,  but he'll never  gain the \\nhearts and souls  of the Uranian  [Ukrainian ]* people . He'll never  extinguish their love of freedom . \\nAnd he will never,  never  weaken  the resolve  of the free world .  \\nWe meet  tonight  in an America that has lived  through  2 of the hardest  years this Nation  has \\never faced . The pandemic  has been  punishing. And so many  families  are living  paycheck  to \\npaycheck,  struggling  to keep  up with the rising  cost of food,  gas, housing,  and so much  more.   \\nI understand,  like many  of you did. My dad had to leave his home  in Scranton,  Pennsylvania,  \\nto find work . So, like many  of you, I grew  up in a family  when  the price of food went  up, it was \\nfelt throughout  the family; it had an impact.  That's why one of the first things  I did as President  \\nwas fight  to pass the American  Rescue Plan, because people  were hurting . We needed  to act, and \\nwe did. \\nFew pieces of legislation  have  done  more\", 'at a critical  moment  in our history  to lift us out of \\na crisis. It fueled  our efforts  to vaccinate  the Nation  and combat  COVID– 19. It deliv ered \\nimmediate economic  relief  to tens of millions  of Americans. It helped  put food on the table . \\nRemember  those long lines  of cars waiting  for hours  just to get a box of food put in their trunk ? It \\ncut the cost of health  care insurance. And as my dad used to say, it gave  the people  \"just a little \\nbit of breathing room. \" \\nAnd unlike  the $2 trillion  tax cut passed  in the previous  administration  that benefit ed the top \\n1 percent  of Americans,  the American  Rescue Plan——  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  ——the  American  Rescue  Plan helped  working people  and left no one \\nbehind. And,  folks —and  it worked . It worked . It worked  and created  jobs, lots of jobs. In fact, our \\neconomy  created  over 6.5 million  new jobs just last year,  more  jobs in 1 year than ever before  in \\nthe history  of the', \"United  States of America. The economy  grew at a rate of 5.7 last year, the \\nstrongest  growth  rate in 40 years and the first step in bringing  fundamental  change  to our \\neconomy  that hasn't worked for working  people  in this Nation  for too long.  \\nFor the past 40 years,  we were told that tax breaks for those  at the top and benefits would \\ntrickle  down and everyone  would benefit.  But that trickle -down theory  led to a weaker  economic \\ngrowth,  lower  wages,  bigger  deficits,  and a widening gap between  the top and everyone else in \\nthe—in nearly  a century .   \\nLook,  Vice President  Harris and I ran for office —and  I realize we have  fundamental  \\ndisagreements on this—but  ran for office  with a new economic  vision  for America:  invest  in \\nAmerica;  educate Americans;  grow  the workforce;  build  the economy  from  the bottom  up and the \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"4 middle  out, not from  the top down. Because we know —because we know —when  the middle  \\nclass grows,  the poor go way up, and the wealthy  do very well. \\nAmerica used to have  the best roads,  bridges,  and airports  on Earth . And now our \\ninfrastructure  is ranked  13th in the world . We won't be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st \\ncentury  if we don't fix it. That's why it was so important  to pass the bipartisan  infrastructure law. \\nAnd I thank my Republican  friend s who joined  to invest  and rebuild  America, the single  biggest  \\ninvestment  in history .  \\nIt was a bipartisan  effort,  and I want  to thank the members  of both parties who worked  to \\nmake  it happen. We're done  talking  about  infrastructure  weeks. We're now talkin g about  an \\ninfrastructure  decade. And look,  it's going to transform  America  to put us on a path to win the \\neconomic  competition  of the 21st century  that we face with the rest of the world,  particularly  \\nChina.  I've told Xi\", \"Jinping:  It's never  been  a good bet to bet against  the American  people.  \\nWe'll create good jobs for millions  of Americans— modernizing roads,  airports,  ports,  \\nwaterways—a ll across America. And we'll do it to withstand  the devastating  effects of climate  \\ncrisis and promote  environmental  justice. We'll build  a national  network  of 500,000 electric \\nvehicle charging stations;  begin to replace the poisonous  lead pipes  so every  child,  every  \\nAmerican  has clean  water  to drink  at home  and at school .  \\nWe're going to provide  affordable  high-speed  internet  for every  American —rural,  suburban,  \\nurban,  and Tribal communities . Four  thousand projects have  already  been  announced . Many  of \\nyou have  announced them in your districts.  And tonight  I'm announcing that, this year,  we will \\nstart fixing  over 65,000 miles  of highway and 1,500  bridges  in disrepair . And,  folks,  when  we use \\ntaxpayers' dollars  to rebuild  America,  we're going to do it\", \"by buying American . Buy American  \\nproducts . Support  American  jobs.  \\nThe Federal  Government  spends  about  $600  billion  a year to keep  this country  safe and \\nsecure. There 's been  a law on the books  for almost  a century  to make  sure taxpayers ' dollars  \\nsupport  American  jobs and businesses. Every  administration —Democrat  and Republican —says \\nthey'll do it, but we're actually  doing it. We'll buy America n to make  sure everything  from  the \\ndeck  of an aircraft  carrier  to the steel on highway  guardrails  is made  in America from  beginning \\nto end. All of it. All of it.  \\nBut, folks,  to compete for the jobs of the future,  we also need  to level  the playing field with \\nChina  and other  competitors . That's why it's so important  to pass the bipartisan  innovation act \\nsitting  in Congress  that will make  record  investments in emerging  technologies  and American  \\nmanufacturing.  We used to invest  almost  2 percent  of our GDP  in research  and\", 'development . We \\ndon\\'t now. Can\\'t—China  is. \\nLet me give you one example  why it\\'s so important  to pass.  If you travel  20 miles  east of \\nColumbus,  Ohio,  you\\'ll find a thousand  empty  acres of land. It won\\'t look like much . But if you \\nstop and look closely,  you\\'ll see a \"field of dreams ,\" the ground on which  America \\'s future  will be \\nbuilt. That\\'s  where Intel, the American  company  that helped  build Silicon  Valley,  is going to \\nbuild  a $20 billion  semiconductor  \"mega  site,\" up to eight  state-of -the-art factories in one place. \\nTen thousand  new jobs. And in those  factories,  the average job—about  $135—$135,000  a year.  \\nSome  of the most  sophisticated  manufacturing in the world  to make  computer  chips  the size \\nof a fingertip  that power  the world  and everyday  lives,  from  smartphones,  technology  that—the  \\ninternet —technology  that\\'s  yet to be invented.  But that\\'s just the beginning.  \\nIntel\\'s CEO,  Pat Gelsinger,  who is here tonight —and  I', \"don't  know  where Pat is. Pat? There \\nyou go, Pat. Stand  up. Pat came  to see me, and he told me they're  ready  to increase their \\ninvestment  from  $20 billion  to $100  billion. That would  be the biggest  investment  in\", '5 manufacturing in American  history . And all they\\'re waiting  for is for you to pass this bill. So let\\'s \\nnot wait any longer . Send  it to my desk,  I\\'ll sign it, and we will really  take off in a big way.  \\nAnd,  folks,  Intel is not alone . There\\'s  something  happening  in America. Just look around,  \\nand you\\'ll see an amazing  story —the  rebirth  of pride  that comes from  stamping  products  \"Made  \\nin America, \" the revitalization  of American  manufacturing.  Companies  are choosing to build  new \\nfactories here when  just a few years ago, they would  have  gone  overseas. That\\'s what  is \\nhappening.  Ford  is investing $11 billion  in electric vehicles,  creating  11,000  jobs across the \\ncountry.  GM is making the largest  investment  in its history —$7  billion  to build electric vehicles,  \\ncreating  4,000 jobs in Michigan.  All told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were  created  in \\nAmerica last year alone .  \\nAnd, f olks,  powered  by people  I\\'ve met—like  JoJo', 'Burgess from  generations  of union  \\nsteelworkers in Pittsburgh, who\\'s here with us tonight . Where are you, JoJo? There  you go. \\nThanks,  buddy . As Ohio —as Ohio  Senator  Sherrod  Brown  says—[ applause ]—as Sherrod Brown  \\nsays,  \"It\\'s time to bury the label  \\'Rust  Belt.\\' \" It\\'s time to see the—what  used to be called  the Rust \\nBelt become the home  of a significant  resurgence of manufacturing.  \\nAnd with all the bright  spots  in our economy —record  job growth,  higher  wages —too  many  \\nfamilies  are struggling  to keep  up with their bills. Inflation  is robbing them  of gains  they thought  \\notherwise they would be able to feel. I get it. That\\'s why my top priority  is getting  prices unde r \\ncontrol.  \\nLook,  our economy  roared  back  faster  than almost  anyone  predicted,  but the pandemic  \\nmeant  that businesses had a hard time hiring  enough people  because  of the pandemic  to keep  up \\nproduction in their factories.

Thank you. Thank you. Good to be back. As Mitch and Chuck \\nwill un derstand , it's good to be almost home, down the hall. [ Laughter ] Anyway, thank you all.  \\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President —no President has ever said those words from this \\npodium. No President has ever said those words, and it's about time.  \\nFirst Lady —I'm her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; Members of the United \\nStates Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting \\ntonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different, a reminder of the extraordinary times \\nwe're in.  \\nThroughout our history, Presidents have come to this Chamber to speak to Congress, to the \\nNation , and to the world;  to declare war, to celebrate peace;  to announce new plans and \\npossibilities. Tonight I come to talk about crisis and\", 'Volodomyr .', \"6 And here' s the plan.  First, cut the cost of prescription  drugs . We pay more  for the same  drug \\nproduced by the same  company  in America than any other  country  in the world.  Just look at \\ninsulin . One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia,  I met a 13-year -old boy, the handsome  \\nyoung man standing up there,  Joshua  Davis. He and his dad both have  type 1 diabetes,  which \\nmeans they need  insulin  every  single  day. Insulin  costs about  $10 a vial to make . That's  what  it \\ncosts the pharmaceutical  company . But drug companies  charge families  like Joshua  and his dad \\nup to 30 times  that amount.  \\nI spoke  with Joshua 's mom . Imagine  what  it's like to look at your child  who needs  insulin  to \\nstay healthy  and have  no idea how in God's  name  you're going to be able to pay for it—what  it \\ndoes to your family, but what  it does to your dignity,  your ability  to look your child  in the eye, to \\nbe the parent  you expect  yourself  to be. I really  mean\", \"it. Think  about  that. That's  what  I think  \\nabout.  You know,  yesterday —Joshua  is here tonight,  but yesterday  was his birthday . Happy  \\nbirthday,  buddy, by the way.  \\nFor Joshua  and 200,000 other  young  people  with type 1 diabetes,  let's cap the cost of insulin  \\nat $35 a month so everyone  can afford  it. And drug companies will do very,  very well—their  \\nprofit  margin.  And while  we're at it—I know  we have  great disagreements on this floor  with \\nthis—let's  let Medicare negotiate  the price of prescription  drugs . They  already  set the price for \\nVA drugs.  Look,  the American  Rescue Plan is helping  millions  of families  on Affordable  Care  \\nAct plans  to save them  $2,400 a year on their health  premiums . Let's close the coverage gap and \\nmake  those  savings  permanent .  \\nAnd second,  let's cut energy costs for families  an average of $500 a year by combating  \\nclimate change.  Let's provide  an investment  and tax credit  to weatherize your home  and\", \"your \\nbusiness to be energy  efficient  and get a tax credit  for it; double America 's clean  energy  \\nproduction in solar,  wind,  and so much  more;  lower  the price of electric vehicles,  saving  another  \\n$80 a month that you've  not going to have  to pay at the pump.  \\nFolks —third —the  third  thing  we can do to change  the standard  of living for hard-working \\nfolks  is cut the cost of childcare. [Applause ] Cut the cost of childcare. Folks, if you live in a major  \\ncity in America,  you can pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. I was a single  dad for 5 \\nyears,  raising  two kids. I had a lot of help though. I had a mom,  a dad, a brother,  and sister  that \\nreally  helped.  But middle  class and working folks  shouldn' t have  to pay more  than 7 percent  of \\ntheir income  to care for their young children .  \\nMy plan would  cut the cost of childcare in half for most  families  and help parents,  including  \\nmillions  of women  who left the workforce  during the\", \"pandemic  because they couldn' t afford  \\nchildcare to be able to get back  to work,  generating  economic  growth.  But my plan doesn 't stop \\nthere. It also includes  home  and long-term  care,  more  affordable  housing,  pre-K for 3- and 4-\\nyear-olds . All of these will lower  costs to families.  \\nAnd under  my plan,  nobody —let  me say this again —nobody  earning less than $400,000 a \\nyear will pay an additional  penny  in new taxes. Not a single  penny.  I may be wrong,  but my guess  \\nis, if we took a secret  ballot in this floor,  that we'd all agree that the present  tax system  ain't fair. \\nWe have  to fix it. I'm not looking to punish  anybody,  but let's make  corporations  and wealthy  \\nAmericans start paying their fair share.  \\nLook,  last year—[applause ]—last  year—and like Chris  Coons  and Tom  Carper and my \\ndistinguished  Congresswoman —we  come  from  the land of corporate America . There are more  \\ncorporations  incorporated in America [Delaware ]* than every\", 'other  State in America combined . \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.', \"7 And I still won 36 years in a row. The point  is, even they understand  they should pay just a fair \\nshare.  \\nLast year,  55 of the Fortune  500 companies  earned  $40 billion  in profit  and paid zero in \\nFederal  taxes.  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  No, look,  it's not fair. That's why I proposed a 15-percent  minimum  tax rate \\nfor corporations . And w e've got—and  that's why in the G–7 and other  meetings overseas we were \\nable to put together —I was able to be somewhat  helpful —130  countries to agree on a global  \\nminimum  tax rate so companies can't get out of paying  their taxes at home  by shipping  jobs and \\nfactories overseas. It will raise billions  of dollars.  \\nAnd that's why I've proposed closing  loopholes  for the very wealthy  who don't pay—who  \\npay a lower  tax rate than a teacher  and a firefighter.  So that's my plan. But we have —we 'll go into \\nmore  detail  later.  I'm going  to grow —we will grow  the economy,  lower  the costs to families.\", \"So \\nwhat  are we waiting  for? Let's get this done . We all know  we've got to make  changes.  \\nFolks, and while  you're at it, confirm  my nominees  for the Federal  Reserve, which  plays  a \\ncritical  role in fighting inflation.  \\nMy plan will not only lower  costs and give families  a fair shot,  it will lower  the deficit. The \\nprevious  administration  not only ballooned  the deficit  with those tax cuts for the very wealthy  and \\ncorporations,  it undermined the watchdogs —the  job of those  to keep  pandemic  relief  funds  from  \\nbeing wasted . Remember  we had those  debates about  wheth er or not those  watchdogs  should be \\nable to see, every  day, how much  money  was being spent,  where it—was it going to the right  \\nplace?  \\nIn my administration, the watchdogs  are back . And we're going after the criminals who stole  \\nbillions  of relief  money  meant  for small  business and millions  of Americans.  And tonight  I'm \\nannouncing that the Justice Department  will soon\", \"name  a chief  prosecutor  for pandemic  fraud .  \\nAnd look—[applause ]—I think  we all agree—thank you—by  the end of this year,  the deficit  \\nwill be down  to less than half what  it was before  I took office , the only President  ever to cut the \\ndeficit  by more  than $1 trillion  in a single  year.  \\nLowering  your costs also meant  demanding more  competition . I'm a capitalist,  but capitalism  \\nwithout  competition  is not capitalism . Capitalism  without  competition  is exploitation. It drives  up \\nprofits  [prices ].* When  corporations  have  to compete,  their profits  go up and your prices go up—\\nwhen  they don't have  to compete.  Small  businesses and family  farmers  and ranchers—I need  not \\ntell some  of my Republican  friends  from  those  States—guess what ? You've got four basic \\nmeatpacking  facilities . That' s it. You play with them  or you don't get to play at all. And you pay a \\nhell of a lot more —a hell of a lot more —because there 's only four.  \\nSee\", \"what's happening  with ocean  carriers  moving goods  in and out of America. During the \\npandemic,  about  half a dozen  or less foreign -owned  companies  raised  prices by as much  as 1,000 \\npercent  and made  record  profits.  Tonight  I'm announcing a crackdown  on those  companies  \\novercharging American  businesses and consumers.  \\nFolks —[applause ]—and as Wall  Street  firms  take over more  nursing homes,  quality  in those  \\nhomes  has gone  down,  and costs  have  gone  up. That ends on my watch.  Medicare is going to set \\nhigher  standards for nursing homes  and make  sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and \\nthat they inspect and they will—looked  at closely.  We're also going to cut costs to keep  the \\neconomy  going strong  and giving  workers  a fair shot;  provide  more  training  and apprenticeships;  \\nhire them  based  on skills, not just their degrees.\", \"8 Let's pass the Paycheck  Fairness Act and paid leave;  raise the minimum  wage to $15 an \\nhour;  and extend  the child tax credit so no one has to raise a family  in poverty . Let's increase Pell \\ngrants;  increase our historic  support  for HBCUs;  and invest  in what  Jill, our First Lady,  who \\nteaches full time,  calls America 's best kept secret:  community  colleges.  \\nLook,  let's pass the PRO  Act. When  a majority  of worke rs want  to form  a union,  they \\nshouldn' t be able to be stopped . When  we invest  in our workers and we build  an economy  from  \\nthe bottom  up and the middle  out, together  we can do something  we haven 't done  in a long time: \\nbuild  a better  America.  \\nFor more  than 2 years,  COVID has impacted  every  decision  in our lives  and the life of this \\nNation . And I know  you're tired, frustrated,  and exhausted . That doesn 't even  count  the close to a \\nmillion  people  who sit at a dining  room  table  or a kitchen  table  and look at an empty\", 'chair  \\nbecause they lost somebody.   \\nBut I also know  this: Because of the progress we\\'ve made,  because of your resilience and the \\ntools  that we have  been  provided by this Congress,  tonight I can say we\\'re moving forward  safely,  \\nback  to a more —normal  routines.  We\\'ve reached  a new moment  in the fight  against  COVID– 19 \\nwhere severe cases are down to a level  not seen since July of last year.  \\nJust a few days ago, the Center  for Disease Control  and Prevention  issued  a new mask  \\nguidelines . Under  the new guidelines,  most  Americans in most  of the country  can now go mask  \\nfree. And based  on projecti ons, more  of the country  will reach  a point  across—that  point  across \\nthe next couple  of weeks.  And thanks  to the progress we\\'ve made  in the past year,  COVID– 19 no \\nlonger  need  control  our lives . I know  some  are talking  about  \"living  with COVID– 19.\" But \\ntonight I say that we never  will just accept  living  with COVID– 19; we\\'ll continue', \"to combat  the \\nvirus  as we do other  diseases.  \\nAnd because this virus  mutates and spreads,  we have  to stay on guard. And here are four \\ncommonsense steps as we move  forward  safely,  in my view:  first, stay protected  with vaccines \\nand treatments. We know  how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you're vaccinated  and boosted,  \\nyou have  the highest  degree of protection, and we'll  never  give up on vaccinating  more  \\nAmericans.  Now,  I know  parents with kids under  5 are eager  to see their vaccines authorized  for \\ntheir children . Scientists  are working hard to get that done,  and we'll be ready  with plenty  of \\nvaccines if and when  they do. \\nWe're already —we are also ready  with antiviral treatments.  If you get COVID– 19, the Pfizer  \\npill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital  by 90 percent.  I've ordered  more  pills than \\nanyone  in the world  has. Pfizer  is working overtime  to get us a million  pills this month and more  \\nthan double  that\", 'next month.  And now we\\'re launching the \"Test  To Treat\"  initiative  so people  \\ncan get tested  at a pharmacy  and, if they prove  positive,  receive the antiviral pills on the spot at \\nno cost.  \\nAnd, f olks, if you\\'re immunocompromised or have  some  other  vulnerability, we have  \\ntreatments and free high-quality  masks.  We\\'re leaving  no one behind or ignoring  anyone \\'s needs  \\nas we move  forward.  On testing, we\\'ve made  hundreds  of millions  of tests available,  and you can \\norder  them  for free to your doorstep.  And we\\'ve already  ordered  free tests. If you already  ordered  \\nfree tests,  tonight  I\\'m announcing you can order  another  group  of tests. COVID —go to \\nCOVIDt ests.gov,  starting  next week,  and you can get more  tests.  \\nSecond,  we must  prepare for new variants.  Over  the past—we \\'ve gotten  much  better  at \\ndetecting  new variants. If necessary,  we\\'ll be able to develop  [deploy ]* new vaccines within  a \\nhundred days instead  of maybe  months  or', 'years. And if Congress presides [provides ]* the funds  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.', \"9 we need,  we'll have  new stockpiles of tests,  masks,  pills ready  if needed.  I can't promise  a new \\nvariant  won't come,  but I can promise  you we'll do everything  within  our power  to be ready  if it \\ndoes.  \\nThird, we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools  we need.  It's \\ntime for America  to get back  to work  and fill our great  downtowns  again  with people . People  \\nworking from  home  can feel safe and begin to return  to their offices.  \\nWe're doing that here in the Federal  Government . The vast majority  of Federal  workers will \\nonce  again  work  in person.  Our schools  are open. Let's keep  it that way. Our kids need  to be in \\nschool . With  75 percent  of adult  Americans fully  vaccinated  and hospitalizations  down by 77 \\npercent,  most  Americans can remove  their masks and stay in the classroom  and move  forward  \\nsafely.  \\nWe achieved  this because we provided free vaccines,  treatments,  tests,  and masks. Of \\ncourse,\", \"continuing  this costs  money,  so it will not surprise you I'll be back  to see you all. \\n[Laught er] And I'm going to soon send a request  to Congress.  The vast majority  of Americans  \\nhave  used these tools  and may want  again —we may need  them  again . So I expect  Congress —and  \\nI hope  you'll  pass that quickly.  \\nFourth,  we'll  continue  vaccinating  the world . We've sent 475 million  vaccine doses to 112 \\ncountries —more  than any nation  on Earth . We won't stop,  because you can't build a wall high \\nenough to keep  out a vaccine—the  vaccine can stop the spread  of these diseases.   \\nYou know,  we've  lost so much  in COVID– 19. Time  with one another . The worst  of all, the \\nloss of life. Let's use this moment  to reset . So stop looking at COVID as a partisan  dividing  line. \\nSee it for what  it is, a God-awful  disease.  Let's stop sending—seeing  each other  as enemies  and \\nstart seeing  each other  for who we are, fellow  Americans .  \\nLook, we can't change\", \"how divided we've been . That was a long time in coming . But we can \\nchange  how to move  forward  on COVID– 19 and other  issues that we must  face together.  \\nI recently  visited  New York  City Polic e Department  days after the funerals of Officer  \\nWilbert Mora  and his partner,  Officer  Jason  Rivera.  They  were responding to a 911 call when  a \\nman shot and killed  them  with a stolen  gun. Officer  Mora  was 27 years  old. Officer  Rivera  was \\n22 years old. Both  Dominican  Americans who grew up in the same streets that they later chose to \\nparol e—to patrol  as police  officers.  I spoke  with their families, and I told them  that we are \\nforever in debt for their sacrifices and we'll  carry  on their mission  to restore the trust and safety  in \\nevery  community  it deserves.  \\nLike some  of you that have  been  around for a while —I've  worked  with you on these issues \\nfor a long time. I know  what  works:  Investigating  [Investing in]* crime  prevention and\", \"community  policing : cops who walk  the beat,  who know  the neighborhood,  and who can restore \\ntrust and safety.   \\nLet's  not abandon our streets or choose  between  safety  and equal  justice . Let's come  together  \\nand protect  our communities,  restore trust, and hold law enforcement  accountable.  That's why the \\nJustice Department  has required  body  cameras,  banned chokeholds,  and restricted  no-knock \\nwarrants for its officers.  \\nThat's why the American  Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion  that cities, States,  \\nand counties  can use to hire more  police, invest  in more  proven strategies like community  \\nviolence  interruption, trusted  messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma  and giving \\nyoung people  some  hope.  We should all agree the answer  is not to defund the police.  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"10 Audience member.  That's  right!  \\nThe President.  It's to fund the police . Fund  them . Fund them . Fund them  with the resources \\nand training —resources and training  they need  to protect  our communities.  I ask Democrats and \\nRepublicans  alike  to pass my budget  and keep  our neighborhoods  safe. And we'll  do everything \\nin my power  to crack  down on gun trafficking  of ghost  guns  that you can buy online,  assemble  at \\nhome —no serial  numbers,  can't be traced.  I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun \\nviolence . Pass universal  background checks. Why should anyone  on the terrorist  list be able to \\npurchase a weapon . Why ? Why ?  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  And,  folks,  ban assault  weapons  with high-capacity  magazines that hold up to \\na hundred rounds . You think  the deer are wearing  Kevlar  vests? [Laughter ] Look,  repeal  the \\nliability  shield  that makes  gun manufacturers the only industry  in America  that can't be sued—the\", \"only one. Imagine  had we done  that with the tobacco  manufactur ers. These laws don't infringe  on \\nthe Second  Amendment , they save lives.  \\nThe most  fundamental  right  in America is the right  to vote and have  it counted. And look,  \\nit's under  assault.  In State after State, new laws have  been  passed  not only to suppress the vote—\\nwe've  been  there before —but  to subvert  the entire  election . We can't let this happen.  Tonight  I \\ncall on the Senate to pass the Freedom  To Vote act. Pass the John Lewis Act—Voting  Rights  Act. \\nAnd while  you're at it, pass the DISCLOSE Act so Americans know  who is funding our elections.  \\nLook,  tonight  I'd like to honor  someone  who has dedicated  his life to serve this country:  \\nJustice Breyer, an Army  veteran,  constitutional scholar,  retiring  Justice of the United  States  \\nSupreme  Court.  Justice Breyer,  thank you for your service. Thank you, thank  you, thank you. I \\nmean  it. Get up. Stand  and let them  see you.\", \"Thank you.  \\nAnd we all know —no matter  what  your ideology,  we all know  one of the most  serious  \\nconstitutional  responsibilities  a President  has is nominating  someone to serve on the United  States \\nSupreme  Court.  As I did 4 days ago, I've nominated a Circuit  Court  of Appeals— Ketanji  Brown  \\nJackson .  \\nOne of our Nation 's top legal  minds  who will continue  in Justice Breyer 's legacy  of \\nexcellence. A former top litigator  in private  practice,  a former Federal  public  defender  from  a \\nfamily  of public -school  educators and police  officers , she's a consensus  builder.  Since she's been  \\nnominated,  she's received  a broad range  of support,  including  the Fraternal  Order  of Police  and \\nformer judges  appointed by Democrats and Republicans.  \\nFolks, if we are to advance liberty  and justice,  we need  to secure our border  and fix the \\nimmigration  system .  \\nAudience members.  Build  the wall! Build  the wall! Build  the wall!  \\nThe President.  And as\", \"you might  guess,  I think  we can do both. At our border,  we've \\ninstalled  new technology,  like cutting -edge  scanners,  to better  detect  drug smuggling.  We've set \\nup joint patrols  with Mexico  and Guatemala to catch  more  human traffickers.  We're putting  in \\nplace dedicated  immigration  judges  in significant larger  number  so families  fleeing  persecution  \\nand violence  can have  their cases—cases heard  faster —and  those  who don't  [aren't ]* legitimately  \\nhere can be sent back.  \\nWe're screening —we' re securing  commitments  and supporting partners in South  and Central  \\nAmerica to host more  refugees and secure their own borders.  We can do all this while  keeping lit \\nthe torch  of liberty  that has led the generation  of immigrants  to this land, my forebearers and \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", '11 many  of yours.  Provide  a pathway  to citizenship  for \"dreamers,\" those  with temporary  status,  \\nfarmworkers,  essential  workers. To revise our laws so businesses have  workers they need  and \\nfamilies  don\\'t wait decades  to reunite.   \\nIt\\'s not only the right  thing  to do, it\\'s economically  smart  thing  to do. That\\'s why the \\nimmigration  reform  is supported by everyone  from  labor  unions  to religious  leaders to the U.S. \\nChamber  of Commerce . Let\\'s get it done  once  and for all.  \\nFolks, advancing liberty  and justice  also requires protecting  the rights  of women . The \\nconstitutional  right  affirmed  by Roe v. Wade , standing precedent  for half a century,  is under  \\nattack  as never  before.  If you want  to go forward  not backwards,  we must  protect  access to health  \\ncare,  preserve  a woman \\'s right  to choose,  and continue  to advance maternal  health  care for all \\nAmericans.  \\nAnd, folks,  for our LGBTQ+ Americans,  let\\'s finally  get the', \"bipartisan  Equality  Act to my \\ndesk. The onslaught  of State laws targeting  transgender  Americans and their families —it's simply  \\nwrong.  As I said last year,  especially  to our younger  transgender  Americans,  I'll always have  your \\nback  as your President  so you can be yourself  and reach  your God-given potential .  \\nFolks , as I've just demonstrated,  while  it often  appears we do not agree— [laughter ]—and  \\nthat—we do agree on a lot more  things  than we acknowledge.  I signed  80 bipartisan  bills into law \\nlast year,  from  preventing Government  shutdowns,  to protecting  Asian  Americans  from  still-too-\\ncommon  hate crimes,  to reforming  military  justice . And we'll soon be strengthening the Violence \\nAgainst  Women  Act that I first wrote three decades ago.  \\nAnd it's important —it's  important —for us to show  the Nation  that we can come  together  and \\ndo big things.  So tonight  I'm offering  a unity agenda  for the Nation:  four big things  we can do\", \"together,  in my view.  \\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic . There 's so much  we can do: increase  funding for prevention,  \\ntreatment,  harm  reduction,  and recovery;  get rid of outdated rules and stop doctors  and—that  stop \\ndoctors  from  prescribing  treatments;  stop the flow of illicit drugs  by working  with State and local  \\nlaw enforcement  to go after the traffickers . And if you're suffering  from  addiction,  you know —\\nyou should know  you're not alone . I believe in recovery,  and I celebrate the 23 million —23 \\nmillion  Americans in recovery .  \\nSecon d, let's take on mental  health —especially  among  our children,  whose lives  and \\neducation  have  been  turned  upside  down.  The American  Rescue Plan gave  schools  money  to hire \\nteacher s and help students  make  up for lost learning . I urge every  parent  to make  sure your school  \\ndoes just that. They  have  the money.  We can all play a part. Sign up to be a tutor  or a mentor . \\nChildren  were also\", \"struggling before  the pandemic:  bullying, violenc e, trauma,  and the harms  of \\nsocial  media.  \\nAs Frances Haugen,  who is here tonight  with us, has shown,  we must  hold social  media  \\nplatforms  accountable  for the national  experiment  they're conducting on our children  for profit . \\nFolks—[applause ]—thank  you. Thank you for the courage you showed.  It's time to strengthen  \\nprivacy  protections;  ban targeted  advertising  to children;  demand  tech companies stop collecting  \\npersonal  data on our children.  And let's get all Americans the mental  health  services they need . \\nMore people  can turn for help and full parity  between  physical  and mental  health  care if we treat \\nit that way in our insurance.  \\nLook,  the third  piece of that agenda  is support  our veterans. Veterans are the backbone  and \\nthe spine  of this country . They 're the best of us. I've always believed  that we have  a sacred  \\nobligation  to equip those  we send to war and care for those\", 'and their family  when  they come', \"12 home.  My administration  is providing assistance and job training  and housing and now helping \\nlower  income  veterans get VA care debt free. \\nAnd our troops  in Iraq have  faced —and Afghanistan —have  faced  many dangers. One being \\nstationed  at bases,  breathing in toxic  smoke  from  burn pits. Many  of you have  been  there. I've \\nbeen  in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan  over 40 times . These burn pits that incinerate waste —the \\nwastes of war, medical  and hazardous  materi al, jet fuel, and so much  more.  And they come  \\nhome —many  of the world 's fittest and best trained  warriors  in the world —never  the same:  \\nheadaches,  numbness,  dizziness,  a cancer  that would put them  in a flag-draped  coffin . I know.  \\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert . You put them  in. Thirteen  of them.  \\nAudience members.  Whoa!  \\nAudience members. Boo ! \\nThe President.  One of those —one  of those  soldiers was my son, Major  Beau  Biden . I don't \\nknow  for sure if the burn pit that he\", \"lived  near—that  his hooch was near in Iraq and, earlier  than \\nthat, in Kosovo  is the cause of his brain  cancer  and the disease of so many  other  troops . But I'm \\ncommitted  to find out everythi ng we can. \\nCommitted  to military  families like Danielle Robinson  from  Ohio,  the widow  of Sergeant  \\nFirst Class Heath  Robinson. He was born a soldier . Army  National  Guar d. Combat  medic  in \\nKosovo and Iraq. Stationed  near Baghdad,  just yards from  burn pits the size of football  fields.   \\nDanielle is here with us tonight . They  loved  going to Ohio  State  football  games . And he \\nloved building  Legos  with their daughter . But cancer  from  prolonged exposure  to burn pits \\nravaged  Heath 's lungs  and body.  Danielle says Heath  was a fighter  to the very end. He didn' t \\nknow  how to stop fighting,  and neither  did she. Through  her pain,  she found  purpose  to demand \\nthat we do better . Tonight, Danielle,  we are going to do better .  \\nThe VA is pioneering new\", \"ways of linking  toxic  exposures to disease,  already  helping more  \\nveterans get benefits. And tonight  I'm announcin g we're expanding eligibility  to veterans \\nsuffering  from  nine respiratory  cancers.  I'm also calling  on Congress  to pass a law to make  sure \\nveterans devastated  by toxic  exposure  in Iraq and Afghanistan  finally  get the benefits and the \\ncomprehensive health  care they deserve.  \\nAnd fourth  and last, let's end cancer  as we know  it. This is personal . This is personal  to me \\nand to Jill and to Kamala and so many  of you. So many  of you have  lost someone you love—\\nhusband,  wife,  son, daughter,  mom,  dad. Cancer  is the number -two cause of death  in America,  \\nsecond  only to heart  disease.   \\nLast month,  I announced the plan to supercharge the Cancer  Moonshot  that President  Obama \\nasked  me to lead 6 years ago. Our goal is to cut cancer  death  rates by at least 50 percent  over the \\nnext 25 years. And I think we can do bette r than that:\", \"turn cancers from  death  sentences into \\ntreatable diseases,  more  support  for patients and their families.  \\nTo get there,  I call on Congress to fund what  I called  ARPA– H: Advanced  Research  Projects  \\nAgency  for Health . Patterned  after DARPA  in the Defense Department,  projects that led—in \\nDARPA —to the internet,  GPS, and so much  more  that make  our Forces more —safer  and be able \\nto wage war more —with  more  clarity. ARPA [ARPA –H]* will have  a singular  purpose  to drive  \\nbreakthroughs  in cancer,  Alzheimer 's, and diabetes,  and more.  A unity agenda  for the Nation . We \\ncan do these things . It's within  our power . And I don't  see a partisan  edge  to any one of those  four \\nthings.  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"13 My fellow  Americans,  tonight  we've gathered  in a sacred  space:  the citadel  of democracy . In \\nthis Capitol, generation  after generation  of Americans  have  debated  great  questions  amid  great  \\nstrife  and have  done  great  things.  We fought  for freedom,  expanded liberty, debated  [defeated ]* \\ntotalitarianism  and terror. We built the strongest,  freest,  and most  prosperous  nation  the world  has \\never known.   \\nNow is the hour:  our moment  of responsibility, our test of resolve and conscience of history  \\nitself . It is in this moment  that our character  of this generation  is formed,  our purpose  is found,  \\nour future  is forged.  \\nWell, I know  this Nation . We'll  meet  the test, protect  freedom  and liberty, expand  fairness \\nand opportunity. And we will save democracy.  As hard as those  times  have  been,  I'm more  \\noptimistic  about  America today  than I've been  my whole  life because I see the future  that's  within  \\nour grasp,  because I know\", \"there is simply  nothing beyond our capacity.   \\nWe're  the only nation  on Earth  that has always turned every  crisis we've faced  into an \\nopportunity,  the only nation  that can be defined  by a single  word: possibilities. So, on this night,  \\non our 245th year as a nation,  I've come  to report  on the state of the Nation —the  state of the \\nUnion. And my report  is this: The state of the Union  is strong because you, the American  people,  \\nare strong.  \\nWe are stron ger today —we are stronger  today —than  we were a year ago.

Our organization has a clear focus and mission to enable improved business outcomes through advanced technology solutions and analytical expertise. The leadership team is comprised of seasoned healthcare industry experts focused on enabling the technological advancements necessary in today's ever-changing healthcare landscape. Strong foundations in technology systems and solutions and the business acumen to enable predictable business results are keys to our success. Experience, quality, and innovation are the cornerstones of our team's capabilities and are applied to each engagement.   EngageMate© is an HCP/HCO engagements tool developed by Cresen Solutions that enables our clients to fully track HCP and\", 'HCO  engagements throughout the entire life cycle. The system is designed to automate the business lifecycle of any fee for service engagement from business planning through close-out. It will also serve as the auditable system of record for all associated HCP/HCO fee-based contractual arrangements.  There are many problems to be solved in the engagement lifecycle, EngageMate shines in the way it solves these problems.     Below in figure 1 is a diagram of the entire lifecycle that is commonly utilized within the Life Sciences Industry when fee for service contractual services are required:', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\n Figure 1: HCP Engagement Lifecycle All life sciences companies hire health care professionals (HCPs), organizations (HCOs), and other service providers. Engaging a service provider is often a lengthy process with many moving pieces and interactions between departments. During that time, the Compliance department is attempting to keep track of, and approve, all activities and service providers to ensure compliance with external government regulations and internal company policies. The HCP engagement process involves workflow including fair market value (FMV) assessments and exceptions, activity concept reviews, nomination review and approvals, content review/approvals, monetary spend capture, and appropriate certification and activity close-out. As an added layer of complexity, the events can be held around the globe with service providers from many countries, all of whom need their own respective', \"cross-border workflows. While it is possible to track the engagement process via spreadsheets, word documents, and emails, this can be messy and error prone. In today's age of big data and required government reporting, the difficult task of manually tracking engagements is quickly becoming impossible. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have an easy-to-use system where a company can track and manage activities, approvals, and FMV tiers and rates all in one place.  EngageMate© is an elegant system that solves all the problems associated with the engagement lifecycle.  Recently, after an unsatisfactory experience with another engagement tool, a top pharmaceutical company returned to tracking their activities with emails, spreadsheets, and word documents. Cresen Solutions was then brought in to implement EngageMate©. After gathering business requirements around workflow requirements, business rules, and input forms EngageMate© was configured to meet all of the client’s policies and\", 'SOPs. EngageMate© was integrated with their customer', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nmaster to pull service provider information into the system, ensuring accurate Customer(HCP or HCO) details while limiting manual data entry. Review workflows were created for each region within the company enabling a smooth process for the activity to be reviewed by multiple departments and reviewers across the globe. After the workflows are completed EngageMate© assures proper closure and certification processes aligned with company policy. EngageMate© uses all the latest technologies and uses common open integration methodologies to enable easy interfacing with other company business systems.  From adding service providers to filling out forms and submitting activities, business users have enjoyed EngageMate’s© responsiveness and ease of use. Most users were able to pick up the navigation and use of the system after one self-guided training session. Everyone, both “Submitters” and “Reviewers”, receive', \"email notifications when an activity is ready for their action. The email provides an embedded hyperlink that takes users directly to the activity they need to take action on. Additionally, upon logging into EngageMate©, users are presented with a simple landing page showing tiles that separate activities into distinct categories allowing users to see a filtered list of activities to find any activity they are looking for expeditiously. It also includes customizable dashboards that pull information from the system in real-time to provide metrics for activities, service providers used, approvals, and close-out alerts.  Given the ever-changing nature of the life sciences industry and government reporting, flexibility is a top priority for all Cresen Solutions’ product offerings, including EngageMate©. It is easy to create and edit any of the system's forms and needs assessment qualifications from the user interface, including quickly changing language translations. In the most recent\", \"implementation of EngageMate©, the system is translated into Japanese, with the help of translation vendors and the users themselves. Cresen Solutions can accommodate changes or updates to the translations rapidly without downtime. Where EngageMate© shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented in the system without hardcoding and interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time.    Finally, any system must have flexibility in how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable.  This problem is compounded as the user pool grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. EngageMate© allows user profiles to be easily\", \"managed by an administrator to add and remove users, change their assigned department, grant access to specific forms, and change their role in the system. Reviewers, or the administrator on the Reviewer's behalf, can delegate their role to another Reviewer while out on leave.  This allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while they are out of the office.   In conclusion, EngageMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the engagement lifecycle. It allows for the management of the entire engagement process globally.

Our organization has a clear focus and mission to enable improved business outcomes through advanced technology solutions and analytical expertise. The leadership team is comprised of seasoned healthcare industry experts focused on enabling the technological advancements necessary in today's ever-changing healthcare landscape.

Experience, quality, and innovation are the cornerstones of our team's capabilities and are applied to each engagement.  Cresen Solutions developed MonitorMate© to enable our clients to easily assess global\", 'risk, create a calibrated monitoring plan, and track the execution of compliance monitoring and associated remedial events. The system is designed to automate the monitoring process of any company’s unique business need – from the risk assessment to the corrective action tracking for issues identified throughout the monitoring process. Additionally, the system has an automated workflow and email notification capability that eases the monitoring and remediation process of the company.    \\n Figure 1: Risk Monitoring Lifecycle.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nRisk management, auditing, and monitoring processes allow Life Science companies to conform with state and federal regulations while enabling them to also align with relevant internal policies and procedures. Within most companies, the global compliance department identifies potential risks through the execution of their ongoing monitoring process. Assessing the risk enables the organizations to identify weaknesses within the internal controls and identify policies and procedures that should be corrected. Companies can then take necessary corrective actions which ultimately can reduce the number of high-risk issues in the future. Additionally, the compliance department must monitor and document business events and interactions. Most companies lack flexibility and sophistication in identifying and mitigating their risk areas, monitoring, and auditing phases. The majority of these details are often tracked', 'through Excel sheets, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error. This manual tracking process becomes even more complex when the compliance teams are located across the globe in regions with varying international laws. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a refined system where companies can conduct a risk assessment, track monitoring, and remediation details, and easily assess the corrective measures. MonitorMate© is a refined system that seamlessly resolves many of the challenges associated within the risk monitoring lifecycle. Cresen Solutions prides itself on the satisfaction of our clients and the resulting associated improvements in business practices gained by switching from an outdated Excel-based approach to MonitorMate©. The system uses a simple question-based approach to evaluate global risk. The calculated risk value is then split into different ranges with corresponding colors which allows users to easily identify the activities with increased risk.', \"MonitorMate© supports single sign-on (SSO) and can also be integrated with different company source systems like an HR employee feed or a field-based sales roster Where MonitorMate© really shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented within the system without hardcoding and business interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a default value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time. MonitorMate© provides users with a comprehensive set of dashboards – accessible to all levels of the organization – to facilitate the real-time monitoring remediation and escalation of data captured within the system. For example, dynamic visuals such as heat maps are created with real-time data that helps the users to visualize\", '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ncolor-coded risk ratings to quickly identify risk severity. Dashboards, and sensitive or targeted information, can be aligned to different user roles created within the system, based on specific client requirements.  In many companies, compliance organizations can have large geographically dispersed structures with different roles and regions – within MonitorMate© we can customize the logic and associated dashboards to allow users restricted access to specific and relevant data for their regional and/or role assignments. Finally, any system must have the flexibility to support how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable. This problem is compounded as the user base grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. MonitorMate© allows user profiles to be easily managed by an administrator role.  Administrators can add', 'and remove users, limit the user to a specified region, change their assigned region, and change their role in the system. For example, a “monitor” role can assign an activity to multiple reviewers, which allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while a reviewer is out of the office. One of our recent clients had a specific business need that no other monitoring platform could effectively support. We developed a solution that catered to our client’s needs and allowed them to better capture their rep-ride monitoring data. This not only highlights MonitorMate’s© flexibility to accommodate specific business needs, but it ultimately resulted in a more sophisticated approach for capturing, analyzing, and identifying gaps in the field-based compliance monitoring process. In conclusion, MonitorMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the Risk Monitoring lifecycle. It is uniquely designed', 'to comprehensively assess, monitor, and evaluate global risk within a company.

SpendMate© enables companies to meet the growing demand for transparency between industry and medical providers in the form of report preparation, generation, and submission, doing so cost-effectively, and it also easily scales with companies as they expand globally. Transparency reporting has complex requirements, SpendMate© excels in the way it enables healthcare companies to efficiently navigate these requirements. All healthcare companies engage with medical professionals and organizations for various events and other engagements. Transactions from these interactions can include a service fee for speaking at an event, reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, and more. By law, or code, these transactions must be reported in each country where applicable and be made publicly available. Since the governing body can change based on', 'the country or region, the reporting requirements also differ. Another layer of complexity includes intricate business rules that are used to evaluate which transactions are reportable or not. While these reports can be created manually, doing so can prove error prone and time-consuming for compliance teams. When dealing with large numbers of transactions, manually determining which are to be reported is both inefficient and is generally considered poor business practice.  SpendMate© simplifies the spend reporting process by providing the flexibility and scalability needed by our clients to meet the compliance demands of external entities. Recently, SpendMate’s© reporting module was successfully implemented at a top 10 pharmaceutical company, providing greater control and configurability over their previous reporting solution. SpendMate© provides efficiency in form and function by having a user-friendly interface that is driven by a configurable business logic engine.

Using SpendMate’s© end-to-end process, data can be imported from various engagement management systems, processed, validated, and reported using the built-in reporting module.  When operating on a global scale across different countries, users and user permissions must be managed effectively. User roles within SpendMate© are broken into 3 categories, Administrative, Data Coordinator, and Data Entry. Administrative accounts have access to all data and functionalities within SpendMate© and also have the ability to perform system administration and configuration. Data-Coordinators can create and edit transactions and submit them for verification as well as generate country-specific spend reports. To add a layer of data security, Data Coordinators can be assigned to specific countries and will only have access to the', 'assigned country’s data and reports. Lastly, the Data Entry role can be assigned to vendors giving them access to specific forms to enter transactions for commercial and research engagements. Users and their roles can be quickly set up or adjusted by the admins, ensuring a quick transition during times of employee turnover. Below in Figure 1 is an architecture diagram that showcases the different aspects of SpendMate©. \\n Figure 1: SpendMate© Architecture Diagram One key area in which SpendMate© excels is through its various activity management system integrations, allowing SpendMate© to receive a constant flow of data in relation to new events and other engagements between healthcare companies and medical professionals and organizations. The data received from these activity management systems is then cleaned and transformed before being displayed.

SpendMate© can be configured to send a request to a client’s customer master using an API call, and the returned match responses will be displayed for the user to select the matching customer profile. Additionally, SpendMate© supports automatic matching of the customer profiles if certain unique identifiers are present, such as the NPI number or other local identifiers. If duplicate customer profiles exist, SpendMate© has the added functionality of merging and unmerging customers to address these issues. One of the key features of SpendMate© is its reporting module, which supports the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations', '(EFPIA) reports, European Local Law reports, and U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports, Patient Organization (PO) reports, and other country specific reports (Brazil, Colombia, etc.). Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways. For that reason, SpendMate© allows our clients to determine which interactions are reportable and not reportable through business rules using mappings at the country and report type level. The same approach is applied to professional types, for example, a nurse might be reportable in Norway, but not in Switzerland, this can be easily handled through the mapping configurations of each country. For the purposes of validation, a validation file is automatically generated along with each report, following the same input parameters selected on the UI. Within the validation file are two key columns; if the transaction is included on the report and if not, the reason why it is excluded. The validation file can be used to quickly determine why certain transactions are missing from the disclosure report based on the reasoning provided. Users can also quickly adjust the mapping configurations to rectify the issue, if needed.', 'SpendMate’s© reporting module can also generate reports in different currencies and various numeric formats. SpendMate© offers users the choice of prepending or appending a currency code to the amount as per their requirements. The size of compliance teams can vary, therefore, SpendMate© allows for the saving of generated reports within the application. Saved reports can be accessed by everyone on the compliance team thereby reducing the need to constantly regenerate new reports. Reports from prior years can be maintained within the tool and are available for any updates or if a refreshed report is needed. Lastly, SpendMate© has an extensive audit trail capability that includes archiving/audit information on who generated which report, when it was generated, what the', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ninput parameters were, et cetera, allowing the compliance team to keep track of historical information and effectively respond to audit and exception inquires.

EngageMate© is an HCP/HCO engagements tool developed by Cresen Solutions that enables our clients to fully track HCP and\", 'HCO  engagements throughout the entire life cycle. The system is designed to automate the business lifecycle of any fee for service engagement from business planning through close-out. It will also serve as the auditable system of record for all associated HCP/HCO fee-based contractual arrangements.  There are many problems to be solved in the engagement lifecycle, EngageMate shines in the way it solves these problems.     Below in figure 1 is a diagram of the entire lifecycle that is commonly utilized within the Life Sciences Industry when fee for service contractual services are required:', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\n Figure 1: HCP Engagement Lifecycle All life sciences companies hire health care professionals (HCPs), organizations (HCOs), and other service providers. Engaging a service provider is often a lengthy process with many moving pieces and interactions between departments. During that time, the Compliance department is attempting to keep track of, and approve, all activities and service providers to ensure compliance with external government regulations and internal company policies. The HCP engagement process involves workflow including fair market value (FMV) assessments and exceptions, activity concept reviews, nomination review and approvals, content review/approvals, monetary spend capture, and appropriate certification and activity close-out. As an added layer of complexity, the events can be held around the globe with service providers from many countries, all of whom need their own respective', \"cross-border workflows. While it is possible to track the engagement process via spreadsheets, word documents, and emails, this can be messy and error prone. In today's age of big data and required government reporting, the difficult task of manually tracking engagements is quickly becoming impossible. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have an easy-to-use system where a company can track and manage activities, approvals, and FMV tiers and rates all in one place.  EngageMate© is an elegant system that solves all the problems associated with the engagement lifecycle.  Recently, after an unsatisfactory experience with another engagement tool, a top pharmaceutical company returned to tracking their activities with emails, spreadsheets, and word documents. Cresen Solutions was then brought in to implement EngageMate©. After gathering business requirements around workflow requirements, business rules, and input forms EngageMate© was configured to meet all of the client’s policies and\", 'SOPs. EngageMate© was integrated with their customer', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nmaster to pull service provider information into the system, ensuring accurate Customer(HCP or HCO) details while limiting manual data entry. Review workflows were created for each region within the company enabling a smooth process for the activity to be reviewed by multiple departments and reviewers across the globe. After the workflows are completed EngageMate© assures proper closure and certification processes aligned with company policy. EngageMate© uses all the latest technologies and uses common open integration methodologies to enable easy interfacing with other company business systems.  From adding service providers to filling out forms and submitting activities, business users have enjoyed EngageMate’s© responsiveness and ease of use. Most users were able to pick up the navigation and use of the system after one self-guided training session. Everyone, both “Submitters” and “Reviewers”, receive', \"email notifications when an activity is ready for their action. The email provides an embedded hyperlink that takes users directly to the activity they need to take action on. Additionally, upon logging into EngageMate©, users are presented with a simple landing page showing tiles that separate activities into distinct categories allowing users to see a filtered list of activities to find any activity they are looking for expeditiously. It also includes customizable dashboards that pull information from the system in real-time to provide metrics for activities, service providers used, approvals, and close-out alerts.  Given the ever-changing nature of the life sciences industry and government reporting, flexibility is a top priority for all Cresen Solutions’ product offerings, including EngageMate©. It is easy to create and edit any of the system's forms and needs assessment qualifications from the user interface, including quickly changing language translations. In the most recent\", \"implementation of EngageMate©, the system is translated into Japanese, with the help of translation vendors and the users themselves. Cresen Solutions can accommodate changes or updates to the translations rapidly without downtime. Where EngageMate© shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented in the system without hardcoding and interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time.    Finally, any system must have flexibility in how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable.  This problem is compounded as the user pool grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. EngageMate© allows user profiles to be easily\", \"managed by an administrator to add and remove users, change their assigned department, grant access to specific forms, and change their role in the system. Reviewers, or the administrator on the Reviewer's behalf, can delegate their role to another Reviewer while out on leave.  This allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while they are out of the office.   In conclusion, EngageMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the engagement lifecycle.

Cresen Solutions developed MonitorMate© to enable our clients to easily assess global\", 'risk, create a calibrated monitoring plan, and track the execution of compliance monitoring and associated remedial events. The system is designed to automate the monitoring process of any company’s unique business need – from the risk assessment to the corrective action tracking for issues identified throughout the monitoring process. Additionally, the system has an automated workflow and email notification capability that eases the monitoring and remediation process of the company.    \\n Figure 1: Risk Monitoring Lifecycle.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nRisk management, auditing, and monitoring processes allow Life Science companies to conform with state and federal regulations while enabling them to also align with relevant internal policies and procedures. Within most companies, the global compliance department identifies potential risks through the execution of their ongoing monitoring process. Assessing the risk enables the organizations to identify weaknesses within the internal controls and identify policies and procedures that should be corrected. Companies can then take necessary corrective actions which ultimately can reduce the number of high-risk issues in the future. Additionally, the compliance department must monitor and document business events and interactions. Most companies lack flexibility and sophistication in identifying and mitigating their risk areas, monitoring, and auditing phases. The majority of these details are often tracked', 'through Excel sheets, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error. This manual tracking process becomes even more complex when the compliance teams are located across the globe in regions with varying international laws. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a refined system where companies can conduct a risk assessment, track monitoring, and remediation details, and easily assess the corrective measures. MonitorMate© is a refined system that seamlessly resolves many of the challenges associated within the risk monitoring lifecycle. Cresen Solutions prides itself on the satisfaction of our clients and the resulting associated improvements in business practices gained by switching from an outdated Excel-based approach to MonitorMate©. The system uses a simple question-based approach to evaluate global risk. The calculated risk value is then split into different ranges with corresponding colors which allows users to easily identify the activities with increased risk.', \"MonitorMate© supports single sign-on (SSO) and can also be integrated with different company source systems like an HR employee feed or a field-based sales roster Where MonitorMate© really shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented within the system without hardcoding and business interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a default value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time. MonitorMate© provides users with a comprehensive set of dashboards – accessible to all levels of the organization – to facilitate the real-time monitoring remediation and escalation of data captured within the system. For example, dynamic visuals such as heat maps are created with real-time data that helps the users to visualize\", '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ncolor-coded risk ratings to quickly identify risk severity. Dashboards, and sensitive or targeted information, can be aligned to different user roles created within the system, based on specific client requirements.  In many companies, compliance organizations can have large geographically dispersed structures with different roles and regions – within MonitorMate© we can customize the logic and associated dashboards to allow users restricted access to specific and relevant data for their regional and/or role assignments. Finally, any system must have the flexibility to support how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable. This problem is compounded as the user base grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. MonitorMate© allows user profiles to be easily managed by an administrator role.  Administrators can add', 'and remove users, limit the user to a specified region, change their assigned region, and change their role in the system. For example, a “monitor” role can assign an activity to multiple reviewers, which allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while a reviewer is out of the office. One of our recent clients had a specific business need that no other monitoring platform could effectively support. We developed a solution that catered to our client’s needs and allowed them to better capture their rep-ride monitoring data. This not only highlights MonitorMate’s© flexibility to accommodate specific business needs, but it ultimately resulted in a more sophisticated approach for capturing, analyzing, and identifying gaps in the field-based compliance monitoring process. In conclusion, MonitorMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the Risk Monitoring lifecycle.

SpendMate© is a healthcare compliance transparency tool designed to streamline the end-to-end business process of transparency reporting.\", 'Like other offerings in the Cresen Solutions suite, SpendMate© was created in partnership with our life sciences and pharmaceutical customers. SpendMate© enables companies to meet the growing demand for transparency between industry and medical providers in the form of report preparation, generation, and submission, doing so cost-effectively, and it also easily scales with companies as they expand globally. Transparency reporting has complex requirements, SpendMate© excels in the way it enables healthcare companies to efficiently navigate these requirements. All healthcare companies engage with medical professionals and organizations for various events and other engagements. Transactions from these interactions can include a service fee for speaking at an event, reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, and more. By law, or code, these transactions must be reported in each country where applicable and be made publicly available. Since the governing body can change based on', 'the country or region, the reporting requirements also differ. Another layer of complexity includes intricate business rules that are used to evaluate which transactions are reportable or not. While these reports can be created manually, doing so can prove error prone and time-consuming for compliance teams. When dealing with large numbers of transactions, manually determining which are to be reported is both inefficient and is generally considered poor business practice.  SpendMate© simplifies the spend reporting process by providing the flexibility and scalability needed by our clients to meet the compliance demands of external entities. Recently, SpendMate’s© reporting module was successfully implemented at a top 10 pharmaceutical company, providing greater control and configurability over their previous reporting solution. SpendMate© provides efficiency in form and function by having a user-friendly interface that is driven by a configurable business logic engine. This provides the', 'ability to add or remove attributes and business rules at any time without impacting legacy data. The key versatility of SpendMate© lies within its fully customizable forms and templates, allowing Cresen Solutions to', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ntailor the data entry forms and reporting templates to align with the needs of each client. Using SpendMate’s© end-to-end process, data can be imported from various engagement management systems, processed, validated, and reported using the built-in reporting module.  When operating on a global scale across different countries, users and user permissions must be managed effectively. User roles within SpendMate© are broken into 3 categories, Administrative, Data Coordinator, and Data Entry. Administrative accounts have access to all data and functionalities within SpendMate© and also have the ability to perform system administration and configuration. Data-Coordinators can create and edit transactions and submit them for verification as well as generate country-specific spend reports. To add a layer of data security, Data Coordinators can be assigned to specific countries and will only have access to the', 'assigned country’s data and reports. Lastly, the Data Entry role can be assigned to vendors giving them access to specific forms to enter transactions for commercial and research engagements. Users and their roles can be quickly set up or adjusted by the admins, ensuring a quick transition during times of employee turnover. Below in Figure 1 is an architecture diagram that showcases the different aspects of SpendMate©. \\n Figure 1: SpendMate© Architecture Diagram One key area in which SpendMate© excels is through its various activity management system integrations, allowing SpendMate© to receive a constant flow of data in relation to new events and other engagements between healthcare companies and medical professionals and organizations. The data received from these activity management systems is then cleaned and transformed before being displayed. To streamline the user’s access to SpendMate©, single sign-on integrations are supported but not required. Users can review and validate', 'the data within SpendMate© and use its built-in reporting module to generate spend reports specific to each country.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nTo ensure the accuracy of medical professional and organization customer records, SpendMate© has a partnership with Veeva Open Data and can integrate with other third-party vendors that maintain customer reference data to match the unique customer profiles. SpendMate© can be configured to send a request to a client’s customer master using an API call, and the returned match responses will be displayed for the user to select the matching customer profile. Additionally, SpendMate© supports automatic matching of the customer profiles if certain unique identifiers are present, such as the NPI number or other local identifiers. If duplicate customer profiles exist, SpendMate© has the added functionality of merging and unmerging customers to address these issues. One of the key features of SpendMate© is its reporting module, which supports the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations', '(EFPIA) reports, European Local Law reports, and U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports, Patient Organization (PO) reports, and other country specific reports (Brazil, Colombia, etc.). Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways. For that reason, SpendMate© allows our clients to determine which interactions are reportable and not reportable through business rules using mappings at the country and report type level. The same approach is applied to professional types, for example, a nurse might be reportable in Norway, but not in Switzerland, this can be easily handled through the mapping configurations of each country. For the purposes of validation, a validation file is automatically generated along with each report, following the same input parameters selected on the UI. Within the validation file are two key columns; if the transaction is included on the report and if not, the reason why it is excluded. The validation file can be used to quickly determine why certain transactions are missing from the disclosure report based on the reasoning provided. Users can also quickly adjust the mapping configurations to rectify the issue, if needed.', 'SpendMate’s© reporting module can also generate reports in different currencies and various numeric formats. SpendMate© offers users the choice of prepending or appending a currency code to the amount as per their requirements. The size of compliance teams can vary, therefore, SpendMate© allows for the saving of generated reports within the application. Saved reports can be accessed by everyone on the compliance team thereby reducing the need to constantly regenerate new reports. Reports from prior years can be maintained within the tool and are available for any updates or if a refreshed report is needed. Lastly, SpendMate© has an extensive audit trail capability that includes archiving/audit information on who generated which report, when it was generated, what the', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ninput parameters were, et cetera, allowing the compliance team to keep track of historical information and effectively respond to audit and exception inquires.

SpendMate© is a healthcare compliance transparency tool designed to streamline the end-to-end business process of transparency reporting.\", 'Like other offerings in the Cresen Solutions suite, SpendMate© was created in partnership with our life sciences and pharmaceutical customers. SpendMate© enables companies to meet the growing demand for transparency between industry and medical providers in the form of report preparation, generation, and submission, doing so cost-effectively, and it also easily scales with companies as they expand globally. Transparency reporting has complex requirements, SpendMate© excels in the way it enables healthcare companies to efficiently navigate these requirements. All healthcare companies engage with medical professionals and organizations for various events and other engagements. Transactions from these interactions can include a service fee for speaking at an event, reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, and more. By law, or code, these transactions must be reported in each country where applicable and be made publicly available. Since the governing body can change based on', 'the country or region, the reporting requirements also differ. Another layer of complexity includes intricate business rules that are used to evaluate which transactions are reportable or not. While these reports can be created manually, doing so can prove error prone and time-consuming for compliance teams. When dealing with large numbers of transactions, manually determining which are to be reported is both inefficient and is generally considered poor business practice.  SpendMate© simplifies the spend reporting process by providing the flexibility and scalability needed by our clients to meet the compliance demands of external entities. Recently, SpendMate’s© reporting module was successfully implemented at a top 10 pharmaceutical company, providing greater control and configurability over their previous reporting solution. SpendMate© provides efficiency in form and function by having a user-friendly interface that is driven by a configurable business logic engine. This provides the', 'ability to add or remove attributes and business rules at any time without impacting legacy data. The key versatility of SpendMate© lies within its fully customizable forms and templates, allowing Cresen Solutions to', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ntailor the data entry forms and reporting templates to align with the needs of each client. Using SpendMate’s© end-to-end process, data can be imported from various engagement management systems, processed, validated, and reported using the built-in reporting module.  When operating on a global scale across different countries, users and user permissions must be managed effectively. User roles within SpendMate© are broken into 3 categories, Administrative, Data Coordinator, and Data Entry. Administrative accounts have access to all data and functionalities within SpendMate© and also have the ability to perform system administration and configuration. Data-Coordinators can create and edit transactions and submit them for verification as well as generate country-specific spend reports. To add a layer of data security, Data Coordinators can be assigned to specific countries and will only have access to the', 'assigned country’s data and reports. Lastly, the Data Entry role can be assigned to vendors giving them access to specific forms to enter transactions for commercial and research engagements. Users and their roles can be quickly set up or adjusted by the admins, ensuring a quick transition during times of employee turnover. Below in Figure 1 is an architecture diagram that showcases the different aspects of SpendMate©. \\n Figure 1: SpendMate© Architecture Diagram One key area in which SpendMate© excels is through its various activity management system integrations, allowing SpendMate© to receive a constant flow of data in relation to new events and other engagements between healthcare companies and medical professionals and organizations. The data received from these activity management systems is then cleaned and transformed before being displayed. To streamline the user’s access to SpendMate©, single sign-on integrations are supported but not required. Users can review and validate', 'the data within SpendMate© and use its built-in reporting module to generate spend reports specific to each country.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nTo ensure the accuracy of medical professional and organization customer records, SpendMate© has a partnership with Veeva Open Data and can integrate with other third-party vendors that maintain customer reference data to match the unique customer profiles. SpendMate© can be configured to send a request to a client’s customer master using an API call, and the returned match responses will be displayed for the user to select the matching customer profile. Additionally, SpendMate© supports automatic matching of the customer profiles if certain unique identifiers are present, such as the NPI number or other local identifiers. If duplicate customer profiles exist, SpendMate© has the added functionality of merging and unmerging customers to address these issues. One of the key features of SpendMate© is its reporting module, which supports the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations', '(EFPIA) reports, European Local Law reports, and U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports, Patient Organization (PO) reports, and other country specific reports (Brazil, Colombia, etc.). Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways. For that reason, SpendMate© allows our clients to determine which interactions are reportable and not reportable through business rules using mappings at the country and report type level. The same approach is applied to professional types, for example, a nurse might be reportable in Norway, but not in Switzerland, this can be easily handled through the mapping configurations of each country. For the purposes of validation, a validation file is automatically generated along with each report, following the same input parameters selected on the UI. Within the validation file are two key columns; if the transaction is included on the report and if not, the reason why it is excluded. The validation file can be used to quickly determine why certain transactions are missing from the disclosure report based on the reasoning provided. Users can also quickly adjust the mapping configurations to rectify the issue, if needed.', 'SpendMate’s© reporting module can also generate reports in different currencies and various numeric formats. SpendMate© offers users the choice of prepending or appending a currency code to the amount as per their requirements. The size of compliance teams can vary, therefore, SpendMate© allows for the saving of generated reports within the application. Saved reports can be accessed by everyone on the compliance team thereby reducing the need to constantly regenerate new reports. Reports from prior years can be maintained within the tool and are available for any updates or if a refreshed report is needed. Lastly, SpendMate© has an extensive audit trail capability that includes archiving/audit information on who generated which report, when it was generated, what the', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ninput parameters were, et cetera, allowing the compliance team to keep track of historical information and effectively respond to audit and exception inquires.

Engaging a service provider is often a lengthy process with many moving pieces and interactions between departments. During that time, the Compliance department is attempting to keep track of, and approve, all activities and service providers to ensure compliance with external government regulations and internal company policies. The HCP engagement process involves workflow including fair market value (FMV) assessments and exceptions, activity concept reviews, nomination review and approvals, content review/approvals, monetary spend capture, and appropriate certification and activity close-out. As an added layer of complexity, the events can be held around the globe with service providers from many countries, all of whom need their own respective', \"cross-border workflows. While it is possible to track the engagement process via spreadsheets, word documents, and emails, this can be messy and error prone. In today's age of big data and required government reporting, the difficult task of manually tracking engagements is quickly becoming impossible. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have an easy-to-use system where a company can track and manage activities, approvals, and FMV tiers and rates all in one place.  EngageMate© is an elegant system that solves all the problems associated with the engagement lifecycle.  Recently, after an unsatisfactory experience with another engagement tool, a top pharmaceutical company returned to tracking their activities with emails, spreadsheets, and word documents. Cresen Solutions was then brought in to implement EngageMate©. After gathering business requirements around workflow requirements, business rules, and input forms EngageMate© was configured to meet all of the client’s policies and\", 'SOPs. EngageMate© was integrated with their customer', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nmaster to pull service provider information into the system, ensuring accurate Customer(HCP or HCO) details while limiting manual data entry. Review workflows were created for each region within the company enabling a smooth process for the activity to be reviewed by multiple departments and reviewers across the globe. After the workflows are completed EngageMate© assures proper closure and certification processes aligned with company policy. EngageMate© uses all the latest technologies and uses common open integration methodologies to enable easy interfacing with other company business systems.  From adding service providers to filling out forms and submitting activities, business users have enjoyed EngageMate’s© responsiveness and ease of use. Most users were able to pick up the navigation and use of the system after one self-guided training session. Everyone, both “Submitters” and “Reviewers”, receive', \"email notifications when an activity is ready for their action. The email provides an embedded hyperlink that takes users directly to the activity they need to take action on. Additionally, upon logging into EngageMate©, users are presented with a simple landing page showing tiles that separate activities into distinct categories allowing users to see a filtered list of activities to find any activity they are looking for expeditiously. It also includes customizable dashboards that pull information from the system in real-time to provide metrics for activities, service providers used, approvals, and close-out alerts.  Given the ever-changing nature of the life sciences industry and government reporting, flexibility is a top priority for all Cresen Solutions’ product offerings, including EngageMate©. It is easy to create and edit any of the system's forms and needs assessment qualifications from the user interface, including quickly changing language translations. In the most recent\", \"implementation of EngageMate©, the system is translated into Japanese, with the help of translation vendors and the users themselves. Cresen Solutions can accommodate changes or updates to the translations rapidly without downtime. Where EngageMate© shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented in the system without hardcoding and interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time.    Finally, any system must have flexibility in how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable.  This problem is compounded as the user pool grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. EngageMate© allows user profiles to be easily\", \"managed by an administrator to add and remove users, change their assigned department, grant access to specific forms, and change their role in the system. Reviewers, or the administrator on the Reviewer's behalf, can delegate their role to another Reviewer while out on leave.  This allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while they are out of the office.   In conclusion, EngageMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the engagement lifecycle.

Cresen Solutions developed MonitorMate© to enable our clients to easily assess global\", 'risk, create a calibrated monitoring plan, and track the execution of compliance monitoring and associated remedial events. The system is designed to automate the monitoring process of any company’s unique business need – from the risk assessment to the corrective action tracking for issues identified throughout the monitoring process. Additionally, the system has an automated workflow and email notification capability that eases the monitoring and remediation process of the company.    \\n Figure 1: Risk Monitoring Lifecycle.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nRisk management, auditing, and monitoring processes allow Life Science companies to conform with state and federal regulations while enabling them to also align with relevant internal policies and procedures. Within most companies, the global compliance department identifies potential risks through the execution of their ongoing monitoring process. Assessing the risk enables the organizations to identify weaknesses within the internal controls and identify policies and procedures that should be corrected. Companies can then take necessary corrective actions which ultimately can reduce the number of high-risk issues in the future. Additionally, the compliance department must monitor and document business events and interactions. Most companies lack flexibility and sophistication in identifying and mitigating their risk areas, monitoring, and auditing phases. The majority of these details are often tracked', 'through Excel sheets, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error. This manual tracking process becomes even more complex when the compliance teams are located across the globe in regions with varying international laws. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a refined system where companies can conduct a risk assessment, track monitoring, and remediation details, and easily assess the corrective measures. MonitorMate© is a refined system that seamlessly resolves many of the challenges associated within the risk monitoring lifecycle. Cresen Solutions prides itself on the satisfaction of our clients and the resulting associated improvements in business practices gained by switching from an outdated Excel-based approach to MonitorMate©. The system uses a simple question-based approach to evaluate global risk. The calculated risk value is then split into different ranges with corresponding colors which allows users to easily identify the activities with increased risk.', \"MonitorMate© supports single sign-on (SSO) and can also be integrated with different company source systems like an HR employee feed or a field-based sales roster Where MonitorMate© really shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented within the system without hardcoding and business interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a default value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time. MonitorMate© provides users with a comprehensive set of dashboards – accessible to all levels of the organization – to facilitate the real-time monitoring remediation and escalation of data captured within the system. For example, dynamic visuals such as heat maps are created with real-time data that helps the users to visualize\", '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ncolor-coded risk ratings to quickly identify risk severity. Dashboards, and sensitive or targeted information, can be aligned to different user roles created within the system, based on specific client requirements.  In many companies, compliance organizations can have large geographically dispersed structures with different roles and regions – within MonitorMate© we can customize the logic and associated dashboards to allow users restricted access to specific and relevant data for their regional and/or role assignments. Finally, any system must have the flexibility to support how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable. This problem is compounded as the user base grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. MonitorMate© allows user profiles to be easily managed by an administrator role.  Administrators can add', 'and remove users, limit the user to a specified region, change their assigned region, and change their role in the system. For example, a “monitor” role can assign an activity to multiple reviewers, which allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while a reviewer is out of the office. One of our recent clients had a specific business need that no other monitoring platform could effectively support. We developed a solution that catered to our client’s needs and allowed them to better capture their rep-ride monitoring data. This not only highlights MonitorMate’s© flexibility to accommodate specific business needs, but it ultimately resulted in a more sophisticated approach for capturing, analyzing, and identifying gaps in the field-based compliance monitoring process. In conclusion, MonitorMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the Risk Monitoring lifecycle.

EngageMate© was integrated with their customer', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nmaster to pull service provider information into the system, ensuring accurate Customer(HCP or HCO) details while limiting manual data entry. Review workflows were created for each region within the company enabling a smooth process for the activity to be reviewed by multiple departments and reviewers across the globe. After the workflows are completed EngageMate© assures proper closure and certification processes aligned with company policy. EngageMate© uses all the latest technologies and uses common open integration methodologies to enable easy interfacing with other company business systems.  From adding service providers to filling out forms and submitting activities, business users have enjoyed EngageMate’s© responsiveness and ease of use. Most users were able to pick up the navigation and use of the system after one self-guided training session. Everyone, both “Submitters” and “Reviewers”, receive', \"email notifications when an activity is ready for their action. The email provides an embedded hyperlink that takes users directly to the activity they need to take action on. Additionally, upon logging into EngageMate©, users are presented with a simple landing page showing tiles that separate activities into distinct categories allowing users to see a filtered list of activities to find any activity they are looking for expeditiously. It also includes customizable dashboards that pull information from the system in real-time to provide metrics for activities, service providers used, approvals, and close-out alerts.  Given the ever-changing nature of the life sciences industry and government reporting, flexibility is a top priority for all Cresen Solutions’ product offerings, including EngageMate©. It is easy to create and edit any of the system's forms and needs assessment qualifications from the user interface, including quickly changing language translations. In the most recent\", \"implementation of EngageMate©, the system is translated into Japanese, with the help of translation vendors and the users themselves. Cresen Solutions can accommodate changes or updates to the translations rapidly without downtime. Where EngageMate© shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented in the system without hardcoding and interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time.    Finally, any system must have flexibility in how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable.  This problem is compounded as the user pool grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. EngageMate© allows user profiles to be easily\", \"managed by an administrator to add and remove users, change their assigned department, grant access to specific forms, and change their role in the system. Reviewers, or the administrator on the Reviewer's behalf, can delegate their role to another Reviewer while out on leave.  This allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while they are out of the office.   In conclusion, EngageMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the engagement lifecycle. It allows for the management of the entire engagement process globally.

The leadership team is comprised of seasoned healthcare industry experts focused on enabling the technological advancements necessary in today's ever-changing healthcare landscape.

Cresen Solutions developed MonitorMate© to enable our clients to easily assess global\", 'risk, create a calibrated monitoring plan, and track the execution of compliance monitoring and associated remedial events. The system is designed to automate the monitoring process of any company’s unique business need – from the risk assessment to the corrective action tracking for issues identified throughout the monitoring process. Additionally, the system has an automated workflow and email notification capability that eases the monitoring and remediation process of the company.    \\n Figure 1: Risk Monitoring Lifecycle.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nRisk management, auditing, and monitoring processes allow Life Science companies to conform with state and federal regulations while enabling them to also align with relevant internal policies and procedures. Within most companies, the global compliance department identifies potential risks through the execution of their ongoing monitoring process. Assessing the risk enables the organizations to identify weaknesses within the internal controls and identify policies and procedures that should be corrected. Companies can then take necessary corrective actions which ultimately can reduce the number of high-risk issues in the future. Additionally, the compliance department must monitor and document business events and interactions. Most companies lack flexibility and sophistication in identifying and mitigating their risk areas, monitoring, and auditing phases. The majority of these details are often tracked', 'through Excel sheets, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error. This manual tracking process becomes even more complex when the compliance teams are located across the globe in regions with varying international laws. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a refined system where companies can conduct a risk assessment, track monitoring, and remediation details, and easily assess the corrective measures. MonitorMate© is a refined system that seamlessly resolves many of the challenges associated within the risk monitoring lifecycle. Cresen Solutions prides itself on the satisfaction of our clients and the resulting associated improvements in business practices gained by switching from an outdated Excel-based approach to MonitorMate©. The system uses a simple question-based approach to evaluate global risk. The calculated risk value is then split into different ranges with corresponding colors which allows users to easily identify the activities with increased risk.', \"MonitorMate© supports single sign-on (SSO) and can also be integrated with different company source systems like an HR employee feed or a field-based sales roster Where MonitorMate© really shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented within the system without hardcoding and business interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a default value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time. MonitorMate© provides users with a comprehensive set of dashboards – accessible to all levels of the organization – to facilitate the real-time monitoring remediation and escalation of data captured within the system. For example, dynamic visuals such as heat maps are created with real-time data that helps the users to visualize\", '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ncolor-coded risk ratings to quickly identify risk severity. Dashboards, and sensitive or targeted information, can be aligned to different user roles created within the system, based on specific client requirements.  In many companies, compliance organizations can have large geographically dispersed structures with different roles and regions – within MonitorMate© we can customize the logic and associated dashboards to allow users restricted access to specific and relevant data for their regional and/or role assignments. Finally, any system must have the flexibility to support how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable. This problem is compounded as the user base grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. MonitorMate© allows user profiles to be easily managed by an administrator role.  Administrators can add', 'and remove users, limit the user to a specified region, change their assigned region, and change their role in the system. For example, a “monitor” role can assign an activity to multiple reviewers, which allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while a reviewer is out of the office. One of our recent clients had a specific business need that no other monitoring platform could effectively support. We developed a solution that catered to our client’s needs and allowed them to better capture their rep-ride monitoring data. This not only highlights MonitorMate’s© flexibility to accommodate specific business needs, but it ultimately resulted in a more sophisticated approach for capturing, analyzing, and identifying gaps in the field-based compliance monitoring process. In conclusion, MonitorMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the Risk Monitoring lifecycle. It is uniquely designed', 'to comprehensively assess, monitor, and evaluate global risk within a company.

Our organization has a clear focus and mission to enable improved business outcomes through advanced technology solutions and analytical expertise. The leadership team is comprised of seasoned healthcare industry experts focused on enabling the technological advancements necessary in today's ever-changing healthcare landscape.

Experience, quality, and innovation are the cornerstones of our team's capabilities and are applied to each engagement. SpendMate© is a healthcare compliance transparency tool designed to streamline the end-to-end business process of transparency reporting.\", 'Like other offerings in the Cresen Solutions suite, SpendMate© was created in partnership with our life sciences and pharmaceutical customers. SpendMate© enables companies to meet the growing demand for transparency between industry and medical providers in the form of report preparation, generation, and submission, doing so cost-effectively, and it also easily scales with companies as they expand globally. Transparency reporting has complex requirements, SpendMate© excels in the way it enables healthcare companies to efficiently navigate these requirements. All healthcare companies engage with medical professionals and organizations for various events and other engagements. Transactions from these interactions can include a service fee for speaking at an event, reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, and more. By law, or code, these transactions must be reported in each country where applicable and be made publicly available. Since the governing body can change based on', 'the country or region, the reporting requirements also differ. Another layer of complexity includes intricate business rules that are used to evaluate which transactions are reportable or not. While these reports can be created manually, doing so can prove error prone and time-consuming for compliance teams. When dealing with large numbers of transactions, manually determining which are to be reported is both inefficient and is generally considered poor business practice.  SpendMate© simplifies the spend reporting process by providing the flexibility and scalability needed by our clients to meet the compliance demands of external entities. Recently, SpendMate’s© reporting module was successfully implemented at a top 10 pharmaceutical company, providing greater control and configurability over their previous reporting solution. SpendMate© provides efficiency in form and function by having a user-friendly interface that is driven by a configurable business logic engine. This provides the', 'ability to add or remove attributes and business rules at any time without impacting legacy data. The key versatility of SpendMate© lies within its fully customizable forms and templates, allowing Cresen Solutions to', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ntailor the data entry forms and reporting templates to align with the needs of each client. Using SpendMate’s© end-to-end process, data can be imported from various engagement management systems, processed, validated, and reported using the built-in reporting module.  When operating on a global scale across different countries, users and user permissions must be managed effectively. User roles within SpendMate© are broken into 3 categories, Administrative, Data Coordinator, and Data Entry. Administrative accounts have access to all data and functionalities within SpendMate© and also have the ability to perform system administration and configuration. Data-Coordinators can create and edit transactions and submit them for verification as well as generate country-specific spend reports. To add a layer of data security, Data Coordinators can be assigned to specific countries and will only have access to the', 'assigned country’s data and reports. Lastly, the Data Entry role can be assigned to vendors giving them access to specific forms to enter transactions for commercial and research engagements. Users and their roles can be quickly set up or adjusted by the admins, ensuring a quick transition during times of employee turnover. Below in Figure 1 is an architecture diagram that showcases the different aspects of SpendMate©. \\n Figure 1: SpendMate© Architecture Diagram One key area in which SpendMate© excels is through its various activity management system integrations, allowing SpendMate© to receive a constant flow of data in relation to new events and other engagements between healthcare companies and medical professionals and organizations. The data received from these activity management systems is then cleaned and transformed before being displayed. To streamline the user’s access to SpendMate©, single sign-on integrations are supported but not required. Users can review and validate', 'the data within SpendMate© and use its built-in reporting module to generate spend reports specific to each country.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nTo ensure the accuracy of medical professional and organization customer records, SpendMate© has a partnership with Veeva Open Data and can integrate with other third-party vendors that maintain customer reference data to match the unique customer profiles. SpendMate© can be configured to send a request to a client’s customer master using an API call, and the returned match responses will be displayed for the user to select the matching customer profile. Additionally, SpendMate© supports automatic matching of the customer profiles if certain unique identifiers are present, such as the NPI number or other local identifiers. If duplicate customer profiles exist, SpendMate© has the added functionality of merging and unmerging customers to address these issues. One of the key features of SpendMate© is its reporting module, which supports the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations', '(EFPIA) reports, European Local Law reports, and U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports, Patient Organization (PO) reports, and other country specific reports (Brazil, Colombia, etc.). Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways. For that reason, SpendMate© allows our clients to determine which interactions are reportable and not reportable through business rules using mappings at the country and report type level. The same approach is applied to professional types, for example, a nurse might be reportable in Norway, but not in Switzerland, this can be easily handled through the mapping configurations of each country. For the purposes of validation, a validation file is automatically generated along with each report, following the same input parameters selected on the UI. Within the validation file are two key columns; if the transaction is included on the report and if not, the reason why it is excluded. The validation file can be used to quickly determine why certain transactions are missing from the disclosure report based on the reasoning provided. Users can also quickly adjust the mapping configurations to rectify the issue, if needed.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nPayments data in a unique and innovative way.

One-third  of all the inflation  was because of automobile  sales. There \\nweren 't enough semiconductors to make  all the cars that people  wanted  to buy. And guess what ? \\nPrices of automobiles  went  way up, especially  used vehicles as well.  What —and so we have  a \\nchoice.  One way to fight inflation  is to drive  down wages and make  Americans poorer.  I think  I \\nhave  a better  idea to fight  inflation: Lower  your costs,  not your wages.  \\nAnd,  folks,  that means make  more  cars and semiconductors in America,  more  infrastructure \\nand innovation  in America,  more  goods  moving faster  and cheaper  in America,  more  jobs where \\nyou can earn a good living\", 'risk, create a calibrated monitoring plan, and track the execution of compliance monitoring and associated remedial events.

Senior deaths from COVID– 19 are down 80 percent since \\nJanuary —down 80 percent —because of all of you. And more than half of all the adults in \\nAmerica have gotten at least one shot.  \\nAt a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked the  nurse —I said, \"What\\'s it \\nlike?\" She looked at me , and she said, \"It\\'s like every shot is giving a dose of hope\" —was her \\nphrase. \"A dose of hope.\"  \\nA dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune \\ndisease —wrote to me, said she\\'s worried —that she was worrying about bringing the virus home. \\nShe said she then got vaccinated at a large site, i n her car. She said she sat in her car, when she \\ngot vaccinated and just cried , cried out of joy and cried out of relief.  \\nParents seeing  the smiles on their kids\\' faces, for those who are able to go back to school \\nbecause the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.  \\nGrandparents', \"hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a \\nwindow to say goodbye.  It means everything. Those things mean e verything.  \\nYou know, there's still —you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans —\\nthere's still more work to do to beat this virus. We can't let our guard down.  \\nBut tonig ht I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past \\nhundred days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical \\nachievements —logistical achievements —this country has ever seen.  \\nWhat else have we done in those first hundred days?  \\nWe kept our commitment —Democrats and Republicans—of sending $1,400 rescue checks \\nto 85 percent of American households. We've already sent more than 160 million checks out the \\ndoor. It's making the difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people, it's making all the difference in the world.  \\nThe single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said\", \"she couldn't work, but she said the relief \\ncheck put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment.  A \\ngrandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor , \\nsomething she said she put off for months because she didn't have the money.  \\nOne of the  defining images, at least from my perspective, in  this crisis has been cars lined \\nup, cars lined up for miles. And not people who just barely ever start those cars, nice cars lined up \\nfor miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.  I don't know about you, but I didn't \\never think I'd see that in America. And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their \\nown, these people are in this position.  \\nThat's why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of \\nAmericans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.  We're also providing rental \\nassistance—you all know this, but the American people, I want\", \"to make sure they understand —\\nkeeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.  \\nDuring these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act \\nwhen I established the special signup period to do that —800,000 in that period.  We're making \\none of the largest one -time ever investments—ever —in improving health care for veterans. \\nCritical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we're on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.  \\nAnd, in the process, while this was all go ing on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 \\nnew jobs in 100 days , more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.  The\", '3 International Monetary Fund is now estimating our  economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 \\npercent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four \\ndecades.  \\nAmerica is moving —moving forward—but we can\\'t stop now.  We\\'re in competition with \\nChina and other countries to win the 21st c entury. We\\'re at a great inflection point in history. We \\nhave to do more than just build back better —I mean , \"build back.\" We have to build back better. \\nWe have to compete more strenuous ly than we have.  \\nThroughout our history, if you think about it, public investment i n infrastructure has literally \\ntransformed America: our attitudes, as well as our opportunities.  The transconti nental railroad, \\nthe interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United \\nStates of America.  Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of \\nopportunity.  Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon—now we\\'re', \"on Mars—discovering \\nvaccines,  gave us the i nternet , and so much more.  \\nThese are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the \\nGovernment was in a position to make. Time and again, they propel us into the future.  That's why \\nI proposed the American Jobs Plan , a once-in -a-generation investment in America itself. This is \\nthe largest jobs plan since World War  II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation \\ninfrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, \\nrail corridors, transit lines. \\nIt's clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 \\nschools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water , a clear \\nand present danger to our children's health.  \\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the N ation's lead pipes and \\nservice lines so every American can drink clean water. And , in the process, it will create\", \"thousands an d thousands of good- paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with \\nhigh-speed internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn't have it.  This is \\ngoing t o help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st -century economy.  \\nAnd I 'm asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would ——  \\nVice President Kamala D. Harris. Of course.  \\nThe President.  ——because I know it will get done.  \\nIt creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, \\ncatastrophic failures, with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter \\nstorms.  The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission \\nlines needed to build a re silient and fully clean grid. We can do that.  \\nLook, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to \\ntheir careers.  Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic —2\", \"million , and too often bec ause they couldn't get the care they needed to care for their child or care \\nfor an elderly parent who needs help.  \\nEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to g et homecare \\nfor their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it's not important, check out in \\nyour own district , Democrat or Republican. Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern —\\nalmost as much as their children —is taking care o f an elderly loved one who can't be left alone. \\nMedicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our \\ncaregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.\", '4 For too long, we\\'ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the \\nclimate crisis: \"jobs.\" Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think \"climate change,\" I think \"jobs.\"  \\nThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more \\nenergy -efficient buildings and homes ; electrical workers—IBEW members —installing 500,000 \\ncharging stations along our highways so we can own the electric car market. Farmers —farmers \\nplanting cover cr ops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.  \\nLook, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can\\'t be \\nbuilt in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None. No reason. So, folks, there\\'s no reason \\nwhy American workers can\\'t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I \\nmean, there is no reason. We have this capacit y. We have the brightest, best  trained people in the \\nworld.  \\nThe American Jobs Plan is going to', 'create millions of good-paying jobs —jobs Americans \\ncan raise a family on —as my dad would t hen say, \"with a little breathing room.\"  And all the \\ninvestments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: b uy American. Buy \\nAmerican.  And I might note, parenthetically , that does not violate any trade agreement. It\\'s been \\nthe law since the thirties : buy American.  \\nAmerican tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in Americ a to \\ncreate American jobs. That\\'s the way it\\'s supposed to be and it will be in this administration. And \\nI made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been strenuously \\nlimited. It will be American products. \\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of \\nyou—so many of the folks I grew up with—feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that\\'s so \\nrapidly changing i t\\'s frightening.  I want to speak directly to you. Because if you think about it,', 'that\\'s what people are most worried about: \"Can I fit in?\"  \\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions \\nof dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is an 8 -year program. These are good -\\npaying jobs that can\\'t be outsourced.  \\nNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require \\na college degree; 75 percent don\\'t require an associate\\'s degree.  The American Jobs Plan is a blue-\\ncollar blueprint to build America. That\\'s what it is.  \\nAnd it recognizes something I\\'v e always said in this Chamber and the other. Good guys and \\nwomen on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn\\'t build this country. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. So that\\'s why I\\'m calling on Congress to pass the \\nProtect the Right to Organize Act —the PRO Act —and send it to my desk so we can support the \\nright to unionize.  \\nAnd by the way, while you\\'re thinking about sending things to my', \"desk—[ laughter ]—let's \\nraise the minimum wage to $15. No one —no one working 40 hours a week—no one working 40 \\nhours a week should live below  the poverty line.  \\nWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. And while we're doing this, \\nlet's get the Paych eck Fairness Act to my desk as well —equal pay. It's been much too long. And \\nif you're wondering whether it's too long, look behind me.  \\nAnd finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and \\ndevelopment on record. We will see more technological change— and some of you know more \\nabout this than I do—we'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the \\nlast 50. That's how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.\", \"5 And we're falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.  Decades ago, we used to \\ninvest 2 pe rcent of our gross domestic product in America —2 percent of our gross domestic \\nproduct —in research and development.  \\nToday, Mr. Secretary, that's less than 1 percent. Ch ina and other countries are closing in fast. \\nWe have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, \\nbiotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.  \\nThe Secretary of Defense can tell you —and those of you on—who work on national security \\nissues know—the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA—the Defense Advanced \\nResearch Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here —and that's been a long time \\nago—to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security—that's their only job. And it's \\na semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the \\ndiscovery of the internet  to GPS and so much more that 's enhanced\", \"our security.  \\nThe National Institute of Health —the NIH—I believe, should create a similar Advanced \\nResearch Projects Agency for Health. And that would —here's what it would do. It would have a \\nsingular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer's, \\ndiabetes, and cancer.  \\nI'll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President —\\nalmost $9 million going to NIH. And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I'll ne ver \\nforget you standing , Mitch, and saying you'd name it after my deceased son. It meant a lot.  \\nBut so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who di ed of cancer. I can \\nthink of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. So let's end cancer \\nas we know it. It's within our power. It's within our power to do it.  \\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we're talking about, have often had \\nbipartisan support in the past. Vice\", \"President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with \\nDemocrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican \\nSenators who just put forward their own proposal.  \\nSo let's get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the \\ndeep discussions. I'd like to meet with those who have ideas that are different —they think are \\nbetter. I welcome those ideas.  \\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, \\ndoing nothing is not an option. Look, we can't be so busy competing with one another that we \\nforget the competition  that we have with the rest of the world to win t he 21st century.  \\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi: traveled over 17,000 \\nmiles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called \\nto congratulate me, we had a 2 -hour discussion. He's deadly earnest about becoming the most\", \"significant, consequential nation in the world. He and others —autoc rats—think that democracy \\ncan't compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.  \\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once -in-a-\\ngeneration investment in our families and our children. That's why I've introduced the American \\nFamilies Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.  \\nFirst is access to a good education. When this N ation made 12 years of public education \\nuniversal in the last century, it made us the best  educated, best  prepared Nation in the world. It's, I \\nbelieve, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st —in the 20th \\ncentury.\", '6 But the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, \\nparenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, \"Okay, \\nwe\\'re going to deci de what we do in terms of g overnment providing for free education,\" I wonder \\nwhether we\\'d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I \\ndoubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st \\ncentury.  That\\'s why my American Families Plan guarantees 4  additional years of public education \\nfor every person in America, starting as early as we can.  \\nThe great universiti es of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows \\nthat adding 2 years of universal high -quality preschool for every 3 -year -old and 4 -year-old, no \\nmatter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the \\nway through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of', 'graduating and going on \\nbeyond graduation.  The research shows when a young child goes to school —not daycare—they \\nare far mor e likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.  \\nWhen you add 2 years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the \\ndynami c. We can do that.  \\nAnd we\\'ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, \\nTribal Colleges, Minority -Serving Institutions. The reason is: They don\\'t have the endowments, \\nbut their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy —all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.  \\nJill is a community co llege professor who teaches today as First Lady. She\\' s long said —if \\nI\\'ve heard it once, I\\'ve heard it a thousand times: \"Joe, any country that outeducates us is going to \\noutcompete us.\" She\\'ll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill.', \"Second thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable \\nchildcare. We guarantee—and I'm proposing a legislation to guarantee that low - and middle -\\nincome families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children \\nup to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime.  \\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally pr ovide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and \\nmedical leave —family and medical leave. We're one of the few industrial countries in the world . \\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their \\nloved ones —a parent, a spouse, or child.  \\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of \\nAmericans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for ever y child in a family. Up to $3,000 per \\nchild, if they're under 6  years of age—I mean, excuse me—under —over [under ]\\n* 6 years of age, \\nand $3,600 for\", \"children over 6  years of age.  \\nWith two parents, two kids, that's $7,200 in the pockets that's going to help to take care of \\nyour family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child ]* \\npoverty in half. And we can afford it.  So we did that in the last piece of legislation we passed. But \\nlet's extend that c hildcare tax credit at least through the end of 2025.  \\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered health  care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy \\ntheir coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that's really popular on this side of the \\naisle. [Laughter ] But let's make that provision permanent so their premiums don't go back up.  \\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I'm going to work with Congress to address, this year, other \\ncritical priorities for American families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"7 of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women's health. And the \\npandemic has demonstrated how badly —how badly—it's needed. Let's lower deductibles for \\nworking families on the Affordable Care —in the Affordable Care Act. And let's lower \\nprescription drug costs.  \\nWe know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how \\noutrageously expensive drugs are in America.  In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices \\nof anywhere in the world right here in America —nearly three times —for the same drug, nearly \\nthree times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can.  \\nLet's do what we've always talked about for all the years I was down here in this body —in \\nCongress. Let's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. And by the way, i t won't just help people on Medicare,  it will \\nlower prescription drug costs for everyone.  \\nAnd the\", \"money we save, which is bill ions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable \\nCare Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. \\nIt's within our power to do it; let's do it now. We've talked about it long enough. Democrats and \\nRepublicans , let's get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health  care should be a \\nright  and not a privilege in America.  \\nSo how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without \\nincreasing the deficits. Let's start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on \\npeople making less than $400,000. It's —but it's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 \\npercent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair shar e. Just their fair share.  \\nSometimes , I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be \\nable to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.  \\nA recent study shows that 55 of the\", \"nation's biggest corporations paid zero Federal tax last \\nyear. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade \\ntaxes through ta x havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit \\nfrom tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It's not right.  \\nWe're going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pa y for the public \\ninvestments their businesses will benefit from as well. And w e're going to reward work, not just \\nwealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans— those making \\nover $400,000 or more —back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he \\nstarted: 39.6 percent. That's where it was when George W. was President.  \\nWe're going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million \\ndollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a\", 'paycheck. We\\'re only going to affect three -tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by tha t action —\\nthree-tenths of 1 percent.  And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires \\nwho cheat on their taxes. It\\'s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that ar e left, right, \\nand center.  \\nI\\'m not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden—additional tax burden to \\nthe middle class in this country. They\\'re already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair , \\nfiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.  \\nWhen you hear someone say that they don\\'t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or \\ncorporate America, ask them: \"Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to \\ncut?\"', '8 Look, the big tax cut of 2017, remember, it was supposed to pay for itself —that was how it \\nwas sold —and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a \\nhuge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.  \\nInstead of using the tax saving to rai se wages and invest in research and development, it \\npoured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their \\nworkers is now among the largest in history.  According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what \\nthe average w orker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the —below a hundred.  \\nThe pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the \\npandemic : working and middle  class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in \\nAmerica saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion , in the same exact period. Let me \\nsay it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during', 'this pande mic. And \\nthey\\'re now worth more than $4 trillion.  \\nMy fellow Americans, trickle-down—trickle -down—economics has never worked , and it\\'s \\ntime to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. Yo u know, there\\'s a broad \\nconsensus of economists— left, right, center —and they agree what I\\'m proposing will help create \\nmillions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest  value \\ninvestments we can make as a Nation. \\nI\\'ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our \\npower.  In my conversations with world leaders— and I\\'ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now —\\nI\\'ve made it known—I\\'ve made it known—that America is back. And you know what they say? \\nThe comment that I hear most of all from them is they say : \"We see America is back , but for how \\nlong? But for how long?\"  \\nMy fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we\\'re back, but that we\\'re back to stay \\nand that we aren\\'t going to go it', \"alone. We're going to do it by leading with our allies. No one \\nnation can deal with all the crises of our time—from te rrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass \\nmigration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well  as experi encing —what we're experiencing now \\nwith pandemics.  \\nThere's no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply , as it grows \\nto meet our nee ds—and we're meeting them —will become an arsenal f or vaccines for other \\ncountries, just as America was the ars enal of democracy for the world  and, in consequence, \\ninfluenced the world.  \\nBut every American will have access before that occur s—every American will have acce ss \\nto be fully covered by COVID– 19 from the vaccines we have.  \\nLook, the climate crisis is not our fight alone , it's a global fi ght. The United States accounts, \\nas all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for \\n85 percent. That's why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris accord\", \"—because if we do \\neverything perfectly, it's not going to ultimately matter. \\nI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the \\nmajor economies of the world—China, Russia, India, the European Union—and I said I'd do it in \\nmy firs t hundred days.  \\nI want to be very blunt about it: I had— my attempt was to make sure that the world could \\nsee there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensus—the \\nconsensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth \\nand opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world.  If you've \\nwatched any of it —and you were all busy; I'm sure you didn't have much time —that's what \\nvirtually every nation said, even the ones that aren't doing their fair share.\", '9 The investments I\\'ve proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that \\nbenefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the \\nglobal economy, including China.  \\nMy discussions—in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, \"We welcome the \\ncompetition. We\\'re not looking for conflict.\" But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America\\'s interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state—to state -owned operations \\nand enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.  \\nI also told President Xi that we\\'ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo -Pacific, just \\nas we do with NATO in Europe, not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. I told him what I\\'ve \\nsaid to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments—our commitment to human rights and fundamental', \"freedoms and to our alliances.  \\nAnd I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic \\nhuman rights are being so blatantly violated. An American President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea, the most unique idea in history: We are \\ncreated, all of us, equal. It's who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we're dealing with the American idea.  \\nWith regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I  made very clear to Putin th at \\nwe're not going to seek—excuse me —escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they \\nturn out to be true. And they turned out to be true , so I responded directly and proportionally to \\nRussia's interference in our elections and the cyber  attacks on our G overnment and our business. \\nThey did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.  \\nBut we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interest. We did\", \"it when we extended the \\nNew START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we're working to do it on climate change. But he \\nunderstands we will  respond.  \\nOn Iran and North Korea—nuclear programs that present serious threats to American \\nsecurity and the security of the world —we're going to be working closely with our allies to \\naddress the threats posed by bot h of these countries through diplomacy, as well as stern \\ndeterrence.  \\nAnd American leadership means ending the fore ver war in Afghanistan. We have, without \\nhyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a war  zone.  Today , we have servicemembers \\nserving in the same war  zone as their parents did. We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who \\nwere not yet born on 9/11.  \\nThe war in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be \\nmultigenerational undert akings of nation -building. We went to Afghanistan to\", \"get terrorists —the \\nterrorists who attacked us on 9/11 —and we said we would follow Usama bin Laden to the gates \\nof hell to do it. If you've been to the upper Kunar Valley, you've kind of seen the gates of hell. \\nAnd we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of A l Qai da in \\nAfghanistan. And after 20 years of value—valor and sacrifice, it's time to bring those troops \\nhome.  \\nLook, even as we do, we will maintain an over -the-horizon capacity to suppress future \\nthreats to the homeland. And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has—terrorism has metastasized. The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan. And those of you in the \\nintelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al\", '10 Qaida and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and \\nbeyond.  \\nAnd we won\\'t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal \\nterrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism. We\\'re not going to ignore \\nthat either. \\nMy fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this N ation . It was \\nnearly a year ago, before her father\\'s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd\\'s young daughter. She\\'s a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the \\neye. And she looked at  me and she said, \"My daddy changed the world.\" Well, after the \\nconviction of George Floyd\\'s murderer, we can see how right she was if we have the courage to \\nact as a Congress.  \\nWe\\'ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans. Now is our opportunity \\nto make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our', \"communities, and they serve them honorably.  I know them. I know they want to \\nhelp meet this moment as well.  \\nMy fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement \\nand the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact \\npolice reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already.  I know Republicans have \\ntheir own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate. We need to work together to find a consensus. But let's get it done next month, by the first \\nanniversary of George Floyd's death.  \\nThe country supports this reform, and Congress should act —should act. We have a giant \\nopportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice —real justice. And with the \\nplans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America \\nand American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity —good jobs, good schools,\", \"affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two \\ngenerations because you have an access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of \\nmore Americans: Black, White, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.  \\nLook, I also want to thank the United States Senate for v oting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID –19 \\nHate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. You acted decisively. And \\nyou can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we've seen over the past year —this \\npast year and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, \\nwhich I will gladly, anxiously sign.  \\nI also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans. To \\nall transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want \\nyou to know your President has your back.  \\nAnother thing: Let's authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law\", 'for 27 \\nyears. Twenty -seven years ago, I wrote it. It  will close the —the act that has to be authori zed now \\nwill close the \"boyfriend\" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said:  \\n\"This is an abuser. You can\\'t own a gun.\" It\\'s to close that loophole that existed.  You know, it\\'s \\nestimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America— 50 \\na month. Let\\'s pass it and save some lives.  \\nAnd I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.  The \\nflag at the White House was still flying at half -mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in \\nGeorgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.  And, in the week in', '11 between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 \\nshot dead.  \\nI know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the ninetie s, we passed universal \\nbackground checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds \\nthat can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. \\nCheck out the report over  10 years. But  in the early twenty —2000s, the law expired, and we\\'ve \\nseen daily bloodshed since. I\\'m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn\\'t see bloodshed.  \\nMore than 2  weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I \\nknow —the survivors and f amilies who lost loved ones to gun violence —I laid out several  of the \\nDepartment of Justice actions that are being taken to  impact on this epidemic.  \\nOne of them is banning so- called \"ghost guns.\" The se are homemade guns built from a kit \\nthat includes directions on how to finish the firearm. The', \"parts have no serial numbers, so they \\nshow up at crime scenes,  and they can't be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren't \\nrequired to pass any background check. Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit \\nand, within 30 minutes , have a weapon that's lethal. But no more.  \\nAnd I will do everything in my power to protect the American peop le from this epidemic of \\ngun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational , but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of \\nDemocrat ic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of \\nguns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't \\nbe done. We did it before, and it worked.  \\nTalk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They'll tell you there's no possible \\njustification for having 100 rounds in a weapon. What do you think: deer are wearing Kevlar \\nvests? [Laughter\", '] No, what\\'s —they\\'ll tell you that there are too many people today who are able \\nto buy a gun,  but shouldn\\'t be able to buy a gun.  \\nThese kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, \\nincluding many gun owners. The country supports reform and is —and Congress should act.  \\nThis shouldn\\'t be a red or blue issue. An d no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You \\ncan\\'t yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater. From the very beginning, there were certain guns, \\nweapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons \\never.  We\\'re not changing the Constitution; we\\'re being reasonable. I think this is not a Democrat \\nor Republican issue , I think it\\'s an American issue.  \\nAnd here\\'s what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to Amer ica. Let\\'s \\nend our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we\\'ve done nothing about it. It\\'s time to fix', \"it.  \\nOn day one of my P residency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration \\nbill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for  high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it \\nso over 11 million undocumented folks —the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We \\ncan actually —if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to —so take a close look at \\nit. \\nWe have to —also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to —\\nto our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, \\nthe gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.  \\nWhen I was President, my President —when I was Vice President, the President asked me to \\nfocus on provi ding the help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep\", '12 people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last \\nadministration decided it was not worth it. I\\'m restoring the program and as ked Vice President \\nHarris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this. I have absolute confidence she\\'ll get the job done.  \\nNow, look, if you don\\'t like my plan, le t\\'s at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs \\nto pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for \"dream ers,\" the young peopl e who \\nhave only known America as their home. And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural -made —\\nviolence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our \\ntables.  \\nLook, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our \\nhistory. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let\\'s argue over it, let\\'s debate \\nit, but let\\'s', \"act.  \\nAnd if we truly want to restore the soul of America,  we need to protect the sacred right to \\nvote. Most people —more people voted in the last P residential election than any time in American \\nhistory, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebra ted. Instead, it's being \\nattacked.  Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my \\ndesk right away. The country supports it. The Congress should act now.   \\nLook, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this \\nCapitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds.  Lives were put at risk —many \\nof your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrecti on was an \\nexistential crisis, a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did.  \\nBut the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is \\nboth ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic , still vital today. Can our\", \"democracy deliver on its \\npromise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?  Can our de mocracy deliver the most —to the most pressing needs of our \\npeople?  Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart? \\nAmerica's adversaries —the autocrats of the world —are betting we can't. And I promise you, \\nthey're bett ing we can't. They believe we're too full of anger and division and rage.  They look at \\nthe images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. But they are wrong. You know it; I know it. But we have to prove them wrong.  \\nWe have to prove democracy still works , that our G overnment still works and we can deliver \\nfor our people.  In our first hundred days together, we've acted to r estore the people's faith in \\ndemocracy to deliver. We're vaccinating the N ation. We're creating hundreds of thousands of new \\njobs.\", 'We\\'re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.  \\nOpening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice, that\\'s the \\nessence of America. That\\'s democracy in action.  Our Constitution opens with the words —as trite \\nas it sounds —\"We the People\". Well, it\\'s time to remember that \"We the People\" are the \\nGovernment —you and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we \\nhave no control over. It\\'s us. It\\'s \"We the People.\"  \\nIn another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, \"In \\nAmerica, we do our part.\" We all do our part. That\\'s a ll I\\'m asking: that we do our part, all of us. \\nIf we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will. And the future belongs to \\nAmerica.', '13 As I st and here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our \\nNation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic \\nabout America , not because I\\'m President, because what\\'s happening with the American people.  \\nWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and \"We \\nthe People\" did not flinch.  At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart \\nand fail, we came together. We united.  With light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new \\nresolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more \\nperfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one  Nation, and one America.  \\nFolks, as I told every world leader I\\'ve ever met with over the years, it\\'s never ever, ever \\nbeen a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn\\'t.  \\nWe are the United States of America. There is not a single thing —nothing—not hing beyond \\nour', \"capacity. We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together. So let's begin to get together.  \\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience.  \\nN\\nOTE: The President spoke at 9:0 6 p.m. in the House C hamber of the U.S. Capitol. In his \\nremarks, he referred to Se nate Minority Leader  A.

Thank you so much. \\nMadam  Speaker,  Madam Vice President, and our First Lady  and Second  Gentleman,  Members  of \\nCongress  and the Cabinet,  Justices of the Supreme  Court,  my fellow  Americans:  Last year,  \\nCOVID– 19 kept us apart . This year,  we're finally  together  again.   \\nTonight  we meet  as Democrats,  Republicans,  and Independents,  but most  importantly, as \\nAmericans with a duty to one another , to America,  to the American  people,  and to the \\nConstitution, and an unwavering  resolve that freedom  will always triumph  over tyranny.  \\nSix—[applause ]—thank you. Six days ago, Russia's  Vladimir  Putin  sought  to shake  the very \\nfoundations  of the free world,  thinking he could make  it bend to his menacing  ways. But he badly  \\nmiscalculated . He thought  he\", 'could roll into Ukrain e and the world  would roll over. Instead,  he \\nmet with a wall of strength  he never  anticipated  or imagined . He met the Ukrainian  people .  \\nFrom  President Zelensk iy, their —to every  Ukrainian,  their fearlessness,  their courage,  their \\ndetermination  literally  inspires  the world . Groups  of citizens blocking tanks  with their bodies . \\nEveryone  from  students  to retirees,  to teachers turned soldiers defending  their homeland.  And in \\nthis struggle —President  Zelensk iy said in his speech  to the European  Parliament, \"Light will win \\nover darkness. \" \\nThe Ukrainian  Amba ssador  to the United  States  is here tonight  sitting  with the First Lady . \\nLet each of us, if you\\'re able to stand,  stand  and send an unmistakable  signal  to the world  and \\nUkraine. Thank you. Thank  you, thank  you, thank you. She\\'s bright, she\\'s strong,  and she\\'s \\nresolved . Yes. We, the United  States  of America,  stand  with the Ukrainian  people.  \\nThroughout', \"our history,  we've learned  this lesson:  When  dictators  do not pay a price  for their \\naggression,  they cause more  chaos;  they keep  moving;  and the costs,  the threats to the America—\\nand America,  to the world  keeps rising. That's why the NATO alliance  was created:  to secure \\npeace and stability  in Europe  after World  War II. The United  States is a member,  along with 29 \\nother  nations . It matters. American  diplomacy  matters . American  resolve  matters.  \\nPutin 's latest  attack  on Ukraine was premeditated  and totally  unprovoked. He rejected  \\nrepeated —repeated —efforts  at diplomacy.  He thought  the West and NATO wouldn' t respond . He \\nthought  he could  divide  us at home,  in this Chamber,  in this Nation . He thought  he could divide  \\nus in Europe  as well.   \\nBut Putin  was wrong. We are ready . We are united . And that's what  we did: We stayed  \\nunited.  We prepared  extensively  and carefully . We spent  months  building  coalitions  of other\", \"freedom -loving nations  in Europe  and the Americas to—from  America to the Asian  and African  \\ncontinents  to confront  Putin.  \\nLike many  of you, I spent  countless hours  unifying  our European allies. We shared  with the \\nworld  in advance  what  we knew  Putin  was planning and precisely  how he would try to falsif y and \\njustify  his aggression.  We countered  Russia 's lies with the truth . And now—now  that he's acted,  \\nthe free world  is holding him accountable,  along with 27 members  of the European  Union—\\nincluding  France,  Germany,  Italy—as well as countries  like the United  Kingdom,  Canada,  Japan,  \\nKorea,  Australia,  New Zealand,  and many  others —even Switzerland —are inflicting  pain on \\nRussia and supporting the people  of Ukraine.  Putin  is now isolated  from  the world  more  than he \\nhas ever been.\", \"2 Together,  along  with our allies,  we are right  now enforcing  powerful  economic  sanctions . \\nWe're cutting  off Russia's  largest  banks  from  the international financial  system;  preventing \\nRussia 's Central Bank  from  defending the Russian  ruble,  making Putin 's $630 billion  war fund \\nworthless. We're choking Russia 's access to technology  that will sap its economic  strength  and \\nweaken  its military  for years to come.  \\nTonight  I say to the Russian  oligarchs  and the corrupt  leaders who have bilked  billions  of \\ndollars  off this violent  regime:  No more . The United  States— [applause ]—I mean  it. The United  \\nStates  Department  of Justice is assembling  a dedicated  task force  to go after the crimes  of the \\nRussian  oligarch s. \\nWe're joining  with European allies to find and seize their yachts,  their luxury apartments,  \\ntheir private  jets. We're coming  for your ill-begotten gains.  And tonight  I'm announcing  that we \\nwill join our allies in\", \"closing  off American  air space to all Russian  flights, further isolating  Russia \\nand adding an additional squeeze on their economy .  \\nHe has no idea what 's coming.  The ruble  has already  lost 30 percent  of its value,  the Russian  \\nstock  marke t has lost 40 percent  of its value,  and trading remains suspended.  The Russian  \\neconomy  is reeling,  and Putin  alone  is the one to blame.  \\nTogether  with our allies, we're providing support  to the Ukrainians in their fight  for freedom:  \\nmilitary  assistance,  economic  assistance,  humanitarian  assistance. We're giving  more  than a \\nbillion  dollars  in direct  assistance to Ukraine. And we'll continue  to aid the Ukrainian  people  as \\nthey defend  their country  and help ease their suffering .  \\nBut let me be clear:  Our Forces are not engaged  and will not engage in the conflict with \\nRussian  forces  in Ukraine. Our Forces are not going to Europe  to fight  [in]* Ukraine but to defend  \\nour NATO allies in the event\", \"that Putin  decides to keep  moving west.  For that purpose,  we have  \\nmobilized  American  ground forces,  air squadrons , ship deployments  to protect  NATO countries,  \\nincluding  Poland,  Romania,  Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. And as I've made  crystal  clear,  the \\nUnited  States  and our allies will defend  every  inch of territory  that is NATO territory  with the full \\nforce  of our collective  power —every  single  inch.  \\nAnd we're clear  eyed . The Ukrainians are fighting  back  with pure courage . But the next few \\ndays,  weeks,  and months  will be hard on them.  Putin has unleashed  violence  and chaos. But while  \\nhe may make  gains  on the battlefield, he'll pay a continuing high price  over the long run. And a \\npound of Ukrainian  people —the  proud,  proud people —pound  for pound,  ready  to fight  with \\nevery  inch of energy they have . They 've known 30 years  of independence —have  repeatedly  \\nshown  that they will not tolerate  anyone  who tries to take\", \"their country  backwards.  \\nTo all Americans,  I'll be honest  with you, as I've always promised  I would be. A Russian  \\ndictator  invading a foreign  country  has costs around the world . And I'm taking  robust  action  to \\nmake  sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted  at Russian  economy  and that we use every  tool at \\nour disposal  to protect  American  businesses and consumers.   \\nTonight  I can announce  the United  States  has worked  with 30 other  countries  to release 60 \\nmillion  barrels of oil from  reserves around the world . America will lead that effort,  releasing  30 \\nmillion  barrels of our own Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve. And we stand  ready  to do more  if \\nnecessary,  united  with our allies.  \\nThese steps will help blunt  gas prices here at home . But I know  news about  what 's \\nhappening  can seem  alarming  to all Americans. But I want  you to know:  We're going  to be okay . \\nWe're going to be okay.  \\n                                                 \\n*\", 'White House correction.', \"3 When  the history  of this era is written, Putin 's war on Ukraine will have  left Russia weaker  \\nand the rest of the world  stronger .  \\nWhile  it shouldn' t have  taken  something so terrible  for people  around the world  to see what 's \\nat stake,  now everyone sees it clearly.  We see the unity  among leaders of nations,  a more  unified  \\nEurope,  a more  unified  West.  We see unity  among the people  who are gathering in cities  in large \\ncrowds around the world,  even  in Russia,  to demonstrate their support  for the people  of Ukraine.   \\nIn the battle  between  democracy  and autocracies,  democracies are rising  to the moment , and \\nthe world  is clearly  choosing the side of peace and security.  This is the real test, and it's going  to \\ntake time. So let us continue  to draw inspiration  from  the iron will of the Ukrainian  people.  \\nTo our fellow  Ukrainian  Americans who forged  a deep  bond that connects  our two nations:  \\nWe stand  with you. We stand  with you.\", \"Putin  may circle Kiev with tanks,  but he'll never  gain the \\nhearts and souls  of the Uranian  [Ukrainian ]* people . He'll never  extinguish their love of freedom . \\nAnd he will never,  never  weaken  the resolve  of the free world .  \\nWe meet  tonight  in an America that has lived  through  2 of the hardest  years this Nation  has \\never faced . The pandemic  has been  punishing. And so many  families  are living  paycheck  to \\npaycheck,  struggling  to keep  up with the rising  cost of food,  gas, housing,  and so much  more.   \\nI understand,  like many  of you did. My dad had to leave his home  in Scranton,  Pennsylvania,  \\nto find work . So, like many  of you, I grew  up in a family  when  the price of food went  up, it was \\nfelt throughout  the family; it had an impact.  That's why one of the first things  I did as President  \\nwas fight  to pass the American  Rescue Plan, because people  were hurting . We needed  to act, and \\nwe did. \\nFew pieces of legislation  have  done  more\", 'at a critical  moment  in our history  to lift us out of \\na crisis. It fueled  our efforts  to vaccinate  the Nation  and combat  COVID– 19. It deliv ered \\nimmediate economic  relief  to tens of millions  of Americans. It helped  put food on the table . \\nRemember  those long lines  of cars waiting  for hours  just to get a box of food put in their trunk ? It \\ncut the cost of health  care insurance. And as my dad used to say, it gave  the people  \"just a little \\nbit of breathing room. \" \\nAnd unlike  the $2 trillion  tax cut passed  in the previous  administration  that benefit ed the top \\n1 percent  of Americans,  the American  Rescue Plan——  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  ——the  American  Rescue  Plan helped  working people  and left no one \\nbehind. And,  folks —and  it worked . It worked . It worked  and created  jobs, lots of jobs. In fact, our \\neconomy  created  over 6.5 million  new jobs just last year,  more  jobs in 1 year than ever before  in \\nthe history  of the', \"United  States of America. The economy  grew at a rate of 5.7 last year, the \\nstrongest  growth  rate in 40 years and the first step in bringing  fundamental  change  to our \\neconomy  that hasn't worked for working  people  in this Nation  for too long.  \\nFor the past 40 years,  we were told that tax breaks for those  at the top and benefits would \\ntrickle  down and everyone  would benefit.  But that trickle -down theory  led to a weaker  economic \\ngrowth,  lower  wages,  bigger  deficits,  and a widening gap between  the top and everyone else in \\nthe—in nearly  a century .   \\nLook,  Vice President  Harris and I ran for office —and  I realize we have  fundamental  \\ndisagreements on this—but  ran for office  with a new economic  vision  for America:  invest  in \\nAmerica;  educate Americans;  grow  the workforce;  build  the economy  from  the bottom  up and the \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"4 middle  out, not from  the top down. Because we know —because we know —when  the middle  \\nclass grows,  the poor go way up, and the wealthy  do very well. \\nAmerica used to have  the best roads,  bridges,  and airports  on Earth . And now our \\ninfrastructure  is ranked  13th in the world . We won't be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st \\ncentury  if we don't fix it. That's why it was so important  to pass the bipartisan  infrastructure law. \\nAnd I thank my Republican  friend s who joined  to invest  and rebuild  America, the single  biggest  \\ninvestment  in history .  \\nIt was a bipartisan  effort,  and I want  to thank the members  of both parties who worked  to \\nmake  it happen. We're done  talking  about  infrastructure  weeks. We're now talkin g about  an \\ninfrastructure  decade. And look,  it's going to transform  America  to put us on a path to win the \\neconomic  competition  of the 21st century  that we face with the rest of the world,  particularly  \\nChina.  I've told Xi\", \"Jinping:  It's never  been  a good bet to bet against  the American  people.  \\nWe'll create good jobs for millions  of Americans— modernizing roads,  airports,  ports,  \\nwaterways—a ll across America. And we'll do it to withstand  the devastating  effects of climate  \\ncrisis and promote  environmental  justice. We'll build  a national  network  of 500,000 electric \\nvehicle charging stations;  begin to replace the poisonous  lead pipes  so every  child,  every  \\nAmerican  has clean  water  to drink  at home  and at school .  \\nWe're going to provide  affordable  high-speed  internet  for every  American —rural,  suburban,  \\nurban,  and Tribal communities . Four  thousand projects have  already  been  announced . Many  of \\nyou have  announced them in your districts.  And tonight  I'm announcing that, this year,  we will \\nstart fixing  over 65,000 miles  of highway and 1,500  bridges  in disrepair . And,  folks,  when  we use \\ntaxpayers' dollars  to rebuild  America,  we're going to do it\", \"by buying American . Buy American  \\nproducts . Support  American  jobs.  \\nThe Federal  Government  spends  about  $600  billion  a year to keep  this country  safe and \\nsecure. There 's been  a law on the books  for almost  a century  to make  sure taxpayers ' dollars  \\nsupport  American  jobs and businesses. Every  administration —Democrat  and Republican —says \\nthey'll do it, but we're actually  doing it. We'll buy America n to make  sure everything  from  the \\ndeck  of an aircraft  carrier  to the steel on highway  guardrails  is made  in America from  beginning \\nto end. All of it. All of it.  \\nBut, folks,  to compete for the jobs of the future,  we also need  to level  the playing field with \\nChina  and other  competitors . That's why it's so important  to pass the bipartisan  innovation act \\nsitting  in Congress  that will make  record  investments in emerging  technologies  and American  \\nmanufacturing.  We used to invest  almost  2 percent  of our GDP  in research  and\", 'development . We \\ndon\\'t now. Can\\'t—China  is. \\nLet me give you one example  why it\\'s so important  to pass.  If you travel  20 miles  east of \\nColumbus,  Ohio,  you\\'ll find a thousand  empty  acres of land. It won\\'t look like much . But if you \\nstop and look closely,  you\\'ll see a \"field of dreams ,\" the ground on which  America \\'s future  will be \\nbuilt. That\\'s  where Intel, the American  company  that helped  build Silicon  Valley,  is going to \\nbuild  a $20 billion  semiconductor  \"mega  site,\" up to eight  state-of -the-art factories in one place. \\nTen thousand  new jobs. And in those  factories,  the average job—about  $135—$135,000  a year.  \\nSome  of the most  sophisticated  manufacturing in the world  to make  computer  chips  the size \\nof a fingertip  that power  the world  and everyday  lives,  from  smartphones,  technology  that—the  \\ninternet —technology  that\\'s  yet to be invented.  But that\\'s just the beginning.  \\nIntel\\'s CEO,  Pat Gelsinger,  who is here tonight —and  I', \"don't  know  where Pat is. Pat? There \\nyou go, Pat. Stand  up. Pat came  to see me, and he told me they're  ready  to increase their \\ninvestment  from  $20 billion  to $100  billion. That would  be the biggest  investment  in\", '5 manufacturing in American  history . And all they\\'re waiting  for is for you to pass this bill. So let\\'s \\nnot wait any longer . Send  it to my desk,  I\\'ll sign it, and we will really  take off in a big way.  \\nAnd,  folks,  Intel is not alone . There\\'s  something  happening  in America. Just look around,  \\nand you\\'ll see an amazing  story —the  rebirth  of pride  that comes from  stamping  products  \"Made  \\nin America, \" the revitalization  of American  manufacturing.  Companies  are choosing to build  new \\nfactories here when  just a few years ago, they would  have  gone  overseas. That\\'s what  is \\nhappening.  Ford  is investing $11 billion  in electric vehicles,  creating  11,000  jobs across the \\ncountry.  GM is making the largest  investment  in its history —$7  billion  to build electric vehicles,  \\ncreating  4,000 jobs in Michigan.  All told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were  created  in \\nAmerica last year alone .  \\nAnd, f olks,  powered  by people  I\\'ve met—like  JoJo', 'Burgess from  generations  of union  \\nsteelworkers in Pittsburgh, who\\'s here with us tonight . Where are you, JoJo? There  you go. \\nThanks,  buddy . As Ohio —as Ohio  Senator  Sherrod  Brown  says—[ applause ]—as Sherrod Brown  \\nsays,  \"It\\'s time to bury the label  \\'Rust  Belt.\\' \" It\\'s time to see the—what  used to be called  the Rust \\nBelt become the home  of a significant  resurgence of manufacturing.  \\nAnd with all the bright  spots  in our economy —record  job growth,  higher  wages —too  many  \\nfamilies  are struggling  to keep  up with their bills. Inflation  is robbing them  of gains  they thought  \\notherwise they would be able to feel. I get it. That\\'s why my top priority  is getting  prices unde r \\ncontrol.  \\nLook,  our economy  roared  back  faster  than almost  anyone  predicted,  but the pandemic  \\nmeant  that businesses had a hard time hiring  enough people  because  of the pandemic  to keep  up \\nproduction in their factories. So you didn\\'t  have  people  making those', \"beams  that went  into \\nbuildings  because they were out—the  factory  was closed.  The panic  [pandemic ]* also disrupted \\nthe global  supply  chain . Factories close . When  that happens,  it takes longer  to make  goods  and \\nget them  to the warehouses,  to the stores,  and go—prices  go up. \\nLook at cars last year. One-third  of all the inflation  was because of automobile  sales. There \\nweren 't enough semiconductors to make  all the cars that people  wanted  to buy. And guess what ? \\nPrices of automobiles  went  way up, especially  used vehicles as well.  What —and so we have  a \\nchoice.  One way to fight inflation  is to drive  down wages and make  Americans poorer.  I think  I \\nhave  a better  idea to fight  inflation: Lower  your costs,  not your wages.  \\nAnd,  folks,  that means make  more  cars and semiconductors in America,  more  infrastructure \\nand innovation  in America,  more  goods  moving faster  and cheaper  in America,  more  jobs where \\nyou can earn a good living\", \"in America.  Instead  of relying  on foreign  supply chains,  let's make  it \\nin America.  \\nLook,  economists——  \\nAudience members.  U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! \\nThe Presiden t. Economists ——  \\nAudience members.  U.S.A.! U.S.A.! U.S.A.! \\nThe President.  ——call  this increasing  the productive  capacity  of our economy.  I call it \\nbuilding a better  America. My plan to fight  inflation  will lower  your costs and lower  the deficit . \\nSeventeen  Nobel  laureates in economics said my plan will ease long-term  inflationary  pressures. \\nTop business leaders and, I believe,  most  Americans support  the plan. \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"6 And here' s the plan.  First, cut the cost of prescription  drugs . We pay more  for the same  drug \\nproduced by the same  company  in America than any other  country  in the world.  Just look at \\ninsulin . One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia,  I met a 13-year -old boy, the handsome  \\nyoung man standing up there,  Joshua  Davis. He and his dad both have  type 1 diabetes,  which \\nmeans they need  insulin  every  single  day. Insulin  costs about  $10 a vial to make . That's  what  it \\ncosts the pharmaceutical  company . But drug companies  charge families  like Joshua  and his dad \\nup to 30 times  that amount.  \\nI spoke  with Joshua 's mom . Imagine  what  it's like to look at your child  who needs  insulin  to \\nstay healthy  and have  no idea how in God's  name  you're going to be able to pay for it—what  it \\ndoes to your family, but what  it does to your dignity,  your ability  to look your child  in the eye, to \\nbe the parent  you expect  yourself  to be. I really  mean\", \"it. Think  about  that. That's  what  I think  \\nabout.  You know,  yesterday —Joshua  is here tonight,  but yesterday  was his birthday . Happy  \\nbirthday,  buddy, by the way.  \\nFor Joshua  and 200,000 other  young  people  with type 1 diabetes,  let's cap the cost of insulin  \\nat $35 a month so everyone  can afford  it. And drug companies will do very,  very well—their  \\nprofit  margin.  And while  we're at it—I know  we have  great disagreements on this floor  with \\nthis—let's  let Medicare negotiate  the price of prescription  drugs . They  already  set the price for \\nVA drugs.  Look,  the American  Rescue Plan is helping  millions  of families  on Affordable  Care  \\nAct plans  to save them  $2,400 a year on their health  premiums . Let's close the coverage gap and \\nmake  those  savings  permanent .  \\nAnd second,  let's cut energy costs for families  an average of $500 a year by combating  \\nclimate change.  Let's provide  an investment  and tax credit  to weatherize your home  and\", \"your \\nbusiness to be energy  efficient  and get a tax credit  for it; double America 's clean  energy  \\nproduction in solar,  wind,  and so much  more;  lower  the price of electric vehicles,  saving  another  \\n$80 a month that you've  not going to have  to pay at the pump.  \\nFolks —third —the  third  thing  we can do to change  the standard  of living for hard-working \\nfolks  is cut the cost of childcare. [Applause ] Cut the cost of childcare. Folks, if you live in a major  \\ncity in America,  you can pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. I was a single  dad for 5 \\nyears,  raising  two kids. I had a lot of help though. I had a mom,  a dad, a brother,  and sister  that \\nreally  helped.  But middle  class and working folks  shouldn' t have  to pay more  than 7 percent  of \\ntheir income  to care for their young children .  \\nMy plan would  cut the cost of childcare in half for most  families  and help parents,  including  \\nmillions  of women  who left the workforce  during the\", \"pandemic  because they couldn' t afford  \\nchildcare to be able to get back  to work,  generating  economic  growth.  But my plan doesn 't stop \\nthere. It also includes  home  and long-term  care,  more  affordable  housing,  pre-K for 3- and 4-\\nyear-olds . All of these will lower  costs to families.  \\nAnd under  my plan,  nobody —let  me say this again —nobody  earning less than $400,000 a \\nyear will pay an additional  penny  in new taxes. Not a single  penny.  I may be wrong,  but my guess  \\nis, if we took a secret  ballot in this floor,  that we'd all agree that the present  tax system  ain't fair. \\nWe have  to fix it. I'm not looking to punish  anybody,  but let's make  corporations  and wealthy  \\nAmericans start paying their fair share.  \\nLook,  last year—[applause ]—last  year—and like Chris  Coons  and Tom  Carper and my \\ndistinguished  Congresswoman —we  come  from  the land of corporate America . There are more  \\ncorporations  incorporated in America [Delaware ]* than every\", 'other  State in America combined . \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.', \"7 And I still won 36 years in a row. The point  is, even they understand  they should pay just a fair \\nshare.  \\nLast year,  55 of the Fortune  500 companies  earned  $40 billion  in profit  and paid zero in \\nFederal  taxes.  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  No, look,  it's not fair. That's why I proposed a 15-percent  minimum  tax rate \\nfor corporations . And w e've got—and  that's why in the G–7 and other  meetings overseas we were \\nable to put together —I was able to be somewhat  helpful —130  countries to agree on a global  \\nminimum  tax rate so companies can't get out of paying  their taxes at home  by shipping  jobs and \\nfactories overseas. It will raise billions  of dollars.  \\nAnd that's why I've proposed closing  loopholes  for the very wealthy  who don't pay—who  \\npay a lower  tax rate than a teacher  and a firefighter.  So that's my plan. But we have —we 'll go into \\nmore  detail  later.  I'm going  to grow —we will grow  the economy,  lower  the costs to families.\", \"So \\nwhat  are we waiting  for? Let's get this done . We all know  we've got to make  changes.  \\nFolks, and while  you're at it, confirm  my nominees  for the Federal  Reserve, which  plays  a \\ncritical  role in fighting inflation.  \\nMy plan will not only lower  costs and give families  a fair shot,  it will lower  the deficit. The \\nprevious  administration  not only ballooned  the deficit  with those tax cuts for the very wealthy  and \\ncorporations,  it undermined the watchdogs —the  job of those  to keep  pandemic  relief  funds  from  \\nbeing wasted . Remember  we had those  debates about  wheth er or not those  watchdogs  should be \\nable to see, every  day, how much  money  was being spent,  where it—was it going to the right  \\nplace?  \\nIn my administration, the watchdogs  are back . And we're going after the criminals who stole  \\nbillions  of relief  money  meant  for small  business and millions  of Americans.  And tonight  I'm \\nannouncing that the Justice Department  will soon\", \"name  a chief  prosecutor  for pandemic  fraud .  \\nAnd look—[applause ]—I think  we all agree—thank you—by  the end of this year,  the deficit  \\nwill be down  to less than half what  it was before  I took office , the only President  ever to cut the \\ndeficit  by more  than $1 trillion  in a single  year.  \\nLowering  your costs also meant  demanding more  competition . I'm a capitalist,  but capitalism  \\nwithout  competition  is not capitalism . Capitalism  without  competition  is exploitation. It drives  up \\nprofits  [prices ].* When  corporations  have  to compete,  their profits  go up and your prices go up—\\nwhen  they don't have  to compete.  Small  businesses and family  farmers  and ranchers—I need  not \\ntell some  of my Republican  friends  from  those  States—guess what ? You've got four basic \\nmeatpacking  facilities . That' s it. You play with them  or you don't get to play at all. And you pay a \\nhell of a lot more —a hell of a lot more —because there 's only four.  \\nSee\", \"what's happening  with ocean  carriers  moving goods  in and out of America. During the \\npandemic,  about  half a dozen  or less foreign -owned  companies  raised  prices by as much  as 1,000 \\npercent  and made  record  profits.  Tonight  I'm announcing a crackdown  on those  companies  \\novercharging American  businesses and consumers.  \\nFolks —[applause ]—and as Wall  Street  firms  take over more  nursing homes,  quality  in those  \\nhomes  has gone  down,  and costs  have  gone  up. That ends on my watch.  Medicare is going to set \\nhigher  standards for nursing homes  and make  sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and \\nthat they inspect and they will—looked  at closely.  We're also going to cut costs to keep  the \\neconomy  going strong  and giving  workers  a fair shot;  provide  more  training  and apprenticeships;  \\nhire them  based  on skills, not just their degrees.\", \"8 Let's pass the Paycheck  Fairness Act and paid leave;  raise the minimum  wage to $15 an \\nhour;  and extend  the child tax credit so no one has to raise a family  in poverty . Let's increase Pell \\ngrants;  increase our historic  support  for HBCUs;  and invest  in what  Jill, our First Lady,  who \\nteaches full time,  calls America 's best kept secret:  community  colleges.  \\nLook,  let's pass the PRO  Act. When  a majority  of worke rs want  to form  a union,  they \\nshouldn' t be able to be stopped . When  we invest  in our workers and we build  an economy  from  \\nthe bottom  up and the middle  out, together  we can do something  we haven 't done  in a long time: \\nbuild  a better  America.  \\nFor more  than 2 years,  COVID has impacted  every  decision  in our lives  and the life of this \\nNation . And I know  you're tired, frustrated,  and exhausted . That doesn 't even  count  the close to a \\nmillion  people  who sit at a dining  room  table  or a kitchen  table  and look at an empty\", 'chair  \\nbecause they lost somebody.   \\nBut I also know  this: Because of the progress we\\'ve made,  because of your resilience and the \\ntools  that we have  been  provided by this Congress,  tonight I can say we\\'re moving forward  safely,  \\nback  to a more —normal  routines.  We\\'ve reached  a new moment  in the fight  against  COVID– 19 \\nwhere severe cases are down to a level  not seen since July of last year.  \\nJust a few days ago, the Center  for Disease Control  and Prevention  issued  a new mask  \\nguidelines . Under  the new guidelines,  most  Americans in most  of the country  can now go mask  \\nfree. And based  on projecti ons, more  of the country  will reach  a point  across—that  point  across \\nthe next couple  of weeks.  And thanks  to the progress we\\'ve made  in the past year,  COVID– 19 no \\nlonger  need  control  our lives . I know  some  are talking  about  \"living  with COVID– 19.\" But \\ntonight I say that we never  will just accept  living  with COVID– 19; we\\'ll continue', \"to combat  the \\nvirus  as we do other  diseases.  \\nAnd because this virus  mutates and spreads,  we have  to stay on guard. And here are four \\ncommonsense steps as we move  forward  safely,  in my view:  first, stay protected  with vaccines \\nand treatments. We know  how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you're vaccinated  and boosted,  \\nyou have  the highest  degree of protection, and we'll  never  give up on vaccinating  more  \\nAmericans.  Now,  I know  parents with kids under  5 are eager  to see their vaccines authorized  for \\ntheir children . Scientists  are working hard to get that done,  and we'll be ready  with plenty  of \\nvaccines if and when  they do. \\nWe're already —we are also ready  with antiviral treatments.  If you get COVID– 19, the Pfizer  \\npill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital  by 90 percent.  I've ordered  more  pills than \\nanyone  in the world  has. Pfizer  is working overtime  to get us a million  pills this month and more  \\nthan double  that\", 'next month.  And now we\\'re launching the \"Test  To Treat\"  initiative  so people  \\ncan get tested  at a pharmacy  and, if they prove  positive,  receive the antiviral pills on the spot at \\nno cost.  \\nAnd, f olks, if you\\'re immunocompromised or have  some  other  vulnerability, we have  \\ntreatments and free high-quality  masks.  We\\'re leaving  no one behind or ignoring  anyone \\'s needs  \\nas we move  forward.  On testing, we\\'ve made  hundreds  of millions  of tests available,  and you can \\norder  them  for free to your doorstep.  And we\\'ve already  ordered  free tests. If you already  ordered  \\nfree tests,  tonight  I\\'m announcing you can order  another  group  of tests. COVID —go to \\nCOVIDt ests.gov,  starting  next week,  and you can get more  tests.  \\nSecond,  we must  prepare for new variants.  Over  the past—we \\'ve gotten  much  better  at \\ndetecting  new variants. If necessary,  we\\'ll be able to develop  [deploy ]* new vaccines within  a \\nhundred days instead  of maybe  months  or', 'years. And if Congress presides [provides ]* the funds  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.', \"9 we need,  we'll have  new stockpiles of tests,  masks,  pills ready  if needed.  I can't promise  a new \\nvariant  won't come,  but I can promise  you we'll do everything  within  our power  to be ready  if it \\ndoes.  \\nThird, we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools  we need.  It's \\ntime for America  to get back  to work  and fill our great  downtowns  again  with people . People  \\nworking from  home  can feel safe and begin to return  to their offices.  \\nWe're doing that here in the Federal  Government . The vast majority  of Federal  workers will \\nonce  again  work  in person.  Our schools  are open. Let's keep  it that way. Our kids need  to be in \\nschool . With  75 percent  of adult  Americans fully  vaccinated  and hospitalizations  down by 77 \\npercent,  most  Americans can remove  their masks and stay in the classroom  and move  forward  \\nsafely.  \\nWe achieved  this because we provided free vaccines,  treatments,  tests,  and masks. Of \\ncourse,\", \"continuing  this costs  money,  so it will not surprise you I'll be back  to see you all. \\n[Laught er] And I'm going to soon send a request  to Congress.  The vast majority  of Americans  \\nhave  used these tools  and may want  again —we may need  them  again . So I expect  Congress —and  \\nI hope  you'll  pass that quickly.  \\nFourth,  we'll  continue  vaccinating  the world . We've sent 475 million  vaccine doses to 112 \\ncountries —more  than any nation  on Earth . We won't stop,  because you can't build a wall high \\nenough to keep  out a vaccine—the  vaccine can stop the spread  of these diseases.   \\nYou know,  we've  lost so much  in COVID– 19. Time  with one another . The worst  of all, the \\nloss of life. Let's use this moment  to reset . So stop looking at COVID as a partisan  dividing  line. \\nSee it for what  it is, a God-awful  disease.  Let's stop sending—seeing  each other  as enemies  and \\nstart seeing  each other  for who we are, fellow  Americans .  \\nLook, we can't change\", \"how divided we've been . That was a long time in coming . But we can \\nchange  how to move  forward  on COVID– 19 and other  issues that we must  face together.  \\nI recently  visited  New York  City Polic e Department  days after the funerals of Officer  \\nWilbert Mora  and his partner,  Officer  Jason  Rivera.  They  were responding to a 911 call when  a \\nman shot and killed  them  with a stolen  gun. Officer  Mora  was 27 years  old. Officer  Rivera  was \\n22 years old. Both  Dominican  Americans who grew up in the same streets that they later chose to \\nparol e—to patrol  as police  officers.  I spoke  with their families, and I told them  that we are \\nforever in debt for their sacrifices and we'll  carry  on their mission  to restore the trust and safety  in \\nevery  community  it deserves.  \\nLike some  of you that have  been  around for a while —I've  worked  with you on these issues \\nfor a long time. I know  what  works:  Investigating  [Investing in]* crime  prevention and\", \"community  policing : cops who walk  the beat,  who know  the neighborhood,  and who can restore \\ntrust and safety.   \\nLet's  not abandon our streets or choose  between  safety  and equal  justice . Let's come  together  \\nand protect  our communities,  restore trust, and hold law enforcement  accountable.  That's why the \\nJustice Department  has required  body  cameras,  banned chokeholds,  and restricted  no-knock \\nwarrants for its officers.  \\nThat's why the American  Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion  that cities, States,  \\nand counties  can use to hire more  police, invest  in more  proven strategies like community  \\nviolence  interruption, trusted  messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma  and giving \\nyoung people  some  hope.  We should all agree the answer  is not to defund the police.  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"10 Audience member.  That's  right!  \\nThe President.  It's to fund the police . Fund  them . Fund them . Fund them  with the resources \\nand training —resources and training  they need  to protect  our communities.  I ask Democrats and \\nRepublicans  alike  to pass my budget  and keep  our neighborhoods  safe. And we'll  do everything \\nin my power  to crack  down on gun trafficking  of ghost  guns  that you can buy online,  assemble  at \\nhome —no serial  numbers,  can't be traced.  I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun \\nviolence . Pass universal  background checks. Why should anyone  on the terrorist  list be able to \\npurchase a weapon . Why ? Why ?  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  And,  folks,  ban assault  weapons  with high-capacity  magazines that hold up to \\na hundred rounds . You think  the deer are wearing  Kevlar  vests? [Laughter ] Look,  repeal  the \\nliability  shield  that makes  gun manufacturers the only industry  in America  that can't be sued—the\", \"only one. Imagine  had we done  that with the tobacco  manufactur ers. These laws don't infringe  on \\nthe Second  Amendment , they save lives.  \\nThe most  fundamental  right  in America is the right  to vote and have  it counted. And look,  \\nit's under  assault.  In State after State, new laws have  been  passed  not only to suppress the vote—\\nwe've  been  there before —but  to subvert  the entire  election . We can't let this happen.  Tonight  I \\ncall on the Senate to pass the Freedom  To Vote act. Pass the John Lewis Act—Voting  Rights  Act. \\nAnd while  you're at it, pass the DISCLOSE Act so Americans know  who is funding our elections.  \\nLook,  tonight  I'd like to honor  someone  who has dedicated  his life to serve this country:  \\nJustice Breyer, an Army  veteran,  constitutional scholar,  retiring  Justice of the United  States  \\nSupreme  Court.  Justice Breyer,  thank you for your service. Thank you, thank  you, thank you. I \\nmean  it. Get up. Stand  and let them  see you.\", \"Thank you.  \\nAnd we all know —no matter  what  your ideology,  we all know  one of the most  serious  \\nconstitutional  responsibilities  a President  has is nominating  someone to serve on the United  States \\nSupreme  Court.  As I did 4 days ago, I've nominated a Circuit  Court  of Appeals— Ketanji  Brown  \\nJackson .  \\nOne of our Nation 's top legal  minds  who will continue  in Justice Breyer 's legacy  of \\nexcellence. A former top litigator  in private  practice,  a former Federal  public  defender  from  a \\nfamily  of public -school  educators and police  officers , she's a consensus  builder.  Since she's been  \\nnominated,  she's received  a broad range  of support,  including  the Fraternal  Order  of Police  and \\nformer judges  appointed by Democrats and Republicans.  \\nFolks, if we are to advance liberty  and justice,  we need  to secure our border  and fix the \\nimmigration  system .  \\nAudience members.  Build  the wall! Build  the wall! Build  the wall!  \\nThe President.  And as\", \"you might  guess,  I think  we can do both. At our border,  we've \\ninstalled  new technology,  like cutting -edge  scanners,  to better  detect  drug smuggling.  We've set \\nup joint patrols  with Mexico  and Guatemala to catch  more  human traffickers.  We're putting  in \\nplace dedicated  immigration  judges  in significant larger  number  so families  fleeing  persecution  \\nand violence  can have  their cases—cases heard  faster —and  those  who don't  [aren't ]* legitimately  \\nhere can be sent back.  \\nWe're screening —we' re securing  commitments  and supporting partners in South  and Central  \\nAmerica to host more  refugees and secure their own borders.  We can do all this while  keeping lit \\nthe torch  of liberty  that has led the generation  of immigrants  to this land, my forebearers and \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", '11 many  of yours.  Provide  a pathway  to citizenship  for \"dreamers,\" those  with temporary  status,  \\nfarmworkers,  essential  workers. To revise our laws so businesses have  workers they need  and \\nfamilies  don\\'t wait decades  to reunite.   \\nIt\\'s not only the right  thing  to do, it\\'s economically  smart  thing  to do. That\\'s why the \\nimmigration  reform  is supported by everyone  from  labor  unions  to religious  leaders to the U.S. \\nChamber  of Commerce . Let\\'s get it done  once  and for all.  \\nFolks, advancing liberty  and justice  also requires protecting  the rights  of women . The \\nconstitutional  right  affirmed  by Roe v. Wade , standing precedent  for half a century,  is under  \\nattack  as never  before.  If you want  to go forward  not backwards,  we must  protect  access to health  \\ncare,  preserve  a woman \\'s right  to choose,  and continue  to advance maternal  health  care for all \\nAmericans.  \\nAnd, folks,  for our LGBTQ+ Americans,  let\\'s finally  get the', \"bipartisan  Equality  Act to my \\ndesk. The onslaught  of State laws targeting  transgender  Americans and their families —it's simply  \\nwrong.  As I said last year,  especially  to our younger  transgender  Americans,  I'll always have  your \\nback  as your President  so you can be yourself  and reach  your God-given potential .  \\nFolks , as I've just demonstrated,  while  it often  appears we do not agree— [laughter ]—and  \\nthat—we do agree on a lot more  things  than we acknowledge.  I signed  80 bipartisan  bills into law \\nlast year,  from  preventing Government  shutdowns,  to protecting  Asian  Americans  from  still-too-\\ncommon  hate crimes,  to reforming  military  justice . And we'll soon be strengthening the Violence \\nAgainst  Women  Act that I first wrote three decades ago.  \\nAnd it's important —it's  important —for us to show  the Nation  that we can come  together  and \\ndo big things.  So tonight  I'm offering  a unity agenda  for the Nation:  four big things  we can do\", \"together,  in my view.  \\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic . There 's so much  we can do: increase  funding for prevention,  \\ntreatment,  harm  reduction,  and recovery;  get rid of outdated rules and stop doctors  and—that  stop \\ndoctors  from  prescribing  treatments;  stop the flow of illicit drugs  by working  with State and local  \\nlaw enforcement  to go after the traffickers . And if you're suffering  from  addiction,  you know —\\nyou should know  you're not alone . I believe in recovery,  and I celebrate the 23 million —23 \\nmillion  Americans in recovery .  \\nSecon d, let's take on mental  health —especially  among  our children,  whose lives  and \\neducation  have  been  turned  upside  down.  The American  Rescue Plan gave  schools  money  to hire \\nteacher s and help students  make  up for lost learning . I urge every  parent  to make  sure your school  \\ndoes just that. They  have  the money.  We can all play a part. Sign up to be a tutor  or a mentor . \\nChildren  were also\", \"struggling before  the pandemic:  bullying, violenc e, trauma,  and the harms  of \\nsocial  media.  \\nAs Frances Haugen,  who is here tonight  with us, has shown,  we must  hold social  media  \\nplatforms  accountable  for the national  experiment  they're conducting on our children  for profit . \\nFolks—[applause ]—thank  you. Thank you for the courage you showed.  It's time to strengthen  \\nprivacy  protections;  ban targeted  advertising  to children;  demand  tech companies stop collecting  \\npersonal  data on our children.  And let's get all Americans the mental  health  services they need . \\nMore people  can turn for help and full parity  between  physical  and mental  health  care if we treat \\nit that way in our insurance.  \\nLook,  the third  piece of that agenda  is support  our veterans. Veterans are the backbone  and \\nthe spine  of this country . They 're the best of us. I've always believed  that we have  a sacred  \\nobligation  to equip those  we send to war and care for those\", 'and their family  when  they come', \"12 home.  My administration  is providing assistance and job training  and housing and now helping \\nlower  income  veterans get VA care debt free. \\nAnd our troops  in Iraq have  faced —and Afghanistan —have  faced  many dangers. One being \\nstationed  at bases,  breathing in toxic  smoke  from  burn pits. Many  of you have  been  there. I've \\nbeen  in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan  over 40 times . These burn pits that incinerate waste —the \\nwastes of war, medical  and hazardous  materi al, jet fuel, and so much  more.  And they come  \\nhome —many  of the world 's fittest and best trained  warriors  in the world —never  the same:  \\nheadaches,  numbness,  dizziness,  a cancer  that would put them  in a flag-draped  coffin . I know.  \\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert . You put them  in. Thirteen  of them.  \\nAudience members.  Whoa!  \\nAudience members. Boo ! \\nThe President.  One of those —one  of those  soldiers was my son, Major  Beau  Biden . I don't \\nknow  for sure if the burn pit that he\", \"lived  near—that  his hooch was near in Iraq and, earlier  than \\nthat, in Kosovo  is the cause of his brain  cancer  and the disease of so many  other  troops . But I'm \\ncommitted  to find out everythi ng we can. \\nCommitted  to military  families like Danielle Robinson  from  Ohio,  the widow  of Sergeant  \\nFirst Class Heath  Robinson. He was born a soldier . Army  National  Guar d. Combat  medic  in \\nKosovo and Iraq. Stationed  near Baghdad,  just yards from  burn pits the size of football  fields.   \\nDanielle is here with us tonight . They  loved  going to Ohio  State  football  games . And he \\nloved building  Legos  with their daughter . But cancer  from  prolonged exposure  to burn pits \\nravaged  Heath 's lungs  and body.  Danielle says Heath  was a fighter  to the very end. He didn' t \\nknow  how to stop fighting,  and neither  did she. Through  her pain,  she found  purpose  to demand \\nthat we do better . Tonight, Danielle,  we are going to do better .  \\nThe VA is pioneering new\", \"ways of linking  toxic  exposures to disease,  already  helping more  \\nveterans get benefits. And tonight  I'm announcin g we're expanding eligibility  to veterans \\nsuffering  from  nine respiratory  cancers.  I'm also calling  on Congress  to pass a law to make  sure \\nveterans devastated  by toxic  exposure  in Iraq and Afghanistan  finally  get the benefits and the \\ncomprehensive health  care they deserve.  \\nAnd fourth  and last, let's end cancer  as we know  it. This is personal . This is personal  to me \\nand to Jill and to Kamala and so many  of you. So many  of you have  lost someone you love—\\nhusband,  wife,  son, daughter,  mom,  dad. Cancer  is the number -two cause of death  in America,  \\nsecond  only to heart  disease.   \\nLast month,  I announced the plan to supercharge the Cancer  Moonshot  that President  Obama \\nasked  me to lead 6 years ago. Our goal is to cut cancer  death  rates by at least 50 percent  over the \\nnext 25 years. And I think we can do bette r than that:\", \"turn cancers from  death  sentences into \\ntreatable diseases,  more  support  for patients and their families.  \\nTo get there,  I call on Congress to fund what  I called  ARPA– H: Advanced  Research  Projects  \\nAgency  for Health . Patterned  after DARPA  in the Defense Department,  projects that led—in \\nDARPA —to the internet,  GPS, and so much  more  that make  our Forces more —safer  and be able \\nto wage war more —with  more  clarity. ARPA [ARPA –H]* will have  a singular  purpose  to drive  \\nbreakthroughs  in cancer,  Alzheimer 's, and diabetes,  and more.  A unity agenda  for the Nation . We \\ncan do these things . It's within  our power . And I don't  see a partisan  edge  to any one of those  four \\nthings.  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"13 My fellow  Americans,  tonight  we've gathered  in a sacred  space:  the citadel  of democracy . In \\nthis Capitol, generation  after generation  of Americans  have  debated  great  questions  amid  great  \\nstrife  and have  done  great  things.  We fought  for freedom,  expanded liberty, debated  [defeated ]* \\ntotalitarianism  and terror. We built the strongest,  freest,  and most  prosperous  nation  the world  has \\never known.   \\nNow is the hour:  our moment  of responsibility, our test of resolve and conscience of history  \\nitself . It is in this moment  that our character  of this generation  is formed,  our purpose  is found,  \\nour future  is forged.  \\nWell, I know  this Nation . We'll  meet  the test, protect  freedom  and liberty, expand  fairness \\nand opportunity. And we will save democracy.  As hard as those  times  have  been,  I'm more  \\noptimistic  about  America today  than I've been  my whole  life because I see the future  that's  within  \\nour grasp,  because I know\", \"there is simply  nothing beyond our capacity.   \\nWe're  the only nation  on Earth  that has always turned every  crisis we've faced  into an \\nopportunity,  the only nation  that can be defined  by a single  word: possibilities. So, on this night,  \\non our 245th year as a nation,  I've come  to report  on the state of the Nation —the  state of the \\nUnion. And my report  is this: The state of the Union  is strong because you, the American  people,  \\nare strong.  \\nWe are stron ger today —we are stronger  today —than  we were a year ago. And we'll  be \\nstronger  a year from  now than we are today.  This is our moment  to meet  and overcome the \\nchallenges of our time.

We all know life can knock us \\ndown. But , in America, we never, ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up. Today, that's \\nwhat we're doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over \\ndarkness.  \\nAfter 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view. We're \\nworking again, dreaming\", \"again, discovering again, and leading the world again.  We have shown \\neach other and the world that there's no quit in America —none.  \\nOne hundred days ago , America's house was on fire. And w e had to act. And thanks to the \\nextraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming \\nsupport of the American people —Democrats, Independents, and Republicans —we did act.  \\nTogether we passed the American Rescue Plan , one of the most consequential rescue packages in \\nAmerican history.

Our organization has a clear focus and mission to enable improved business outcomes through advanced technology solutions and analytical expertise. The leadership team is comprised of seasoned healthcare industry experts focused on enabling the technological advancements necessary in today's ever-changing healthcare landscape.

EngageMate© is an HCP/HCO engagements tool developed by Cresen Solutions that enables our clients to fully track HCP and\", 'HCO  engagements throughout the entire life cycle. The system is designed to automate the business lifecycle of any fee for service engagement from business planning through close-out. It will also serve as the auditable system of record for all associated HCP/HCO fee-based contractual arrangements.  There are many problems to be solved in the engagement lifecycle, EngageMate shines in the way it solves these problems.     Below in figure 1 is a diagram of the entire lifecycle that is commonly utilized within the Life Sciences Industry when fee for service contractual services are required:', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\n Figure 1: HCP Engagement Lifecycle All life sciences companies hire health care professionals (HCPs), organizations (HCOs), and other service providers. Engaging a service provider is often a lengthy process with many moving pieces and interactions between departments. During that time, the Compliance department is attempting to keep track of, and approve, all activities and service providers to ensure compliance with external government regulations and internal company policies. The HCP engagement process involves workflow including fair market value (FMV) assessments and exceptions, activity concept reviews, nomination review and approvals, content review/approvals, monetary spend capture, and appropriate certification and activity close-out. As an added layer of complexity, the events can be held around the globe with service providers from many countries, all of whom need their own respective', \"cross-border workflows. While it is possible to track the engagement process via spreadsheets, word documents, and emails, this can be messy and error prone. In today's age of big data and required government reporting, the difficult task of manually tracking engagements is quickly becoming impossible. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have an easy-to-use system where a company can track and manage activities, approvals, and FMV tiers and rates all in one place.  EngageMate© is an elegant system that solves all the problems associated with the engagement lifecycle.  Recently, after an unsatisfactory experience with another engagement tool, a top pharmaceutical company returned to tracking their activities with emails, spreadsheets, and word documents. Cresen Solutions was then brought in to implement EngageMate©. After gathering business requirements around workflow requirements, business rules, and input forms EngageMate© was configured to meet all of the client’s policies and\", 'SOPs. EngageMate© was integrated with their customer', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nmaster to pull service provider information into the system, ensuring accurate Customer(HCP or HCO) details while limiting manual data entry. Review workflows were created for each region within the company enabling a smooth process for the activity to be reviewed by multiple departments and reviewers across the globe. After the workflows are completed EngageMate© assures proper closure and certification processes aligned with company policy. EngageMate© uses all the latest technologies and uses common open integration methodologies to enable easy interfacing with other company business systems.  From adding service providers to filling out forms and submitting activities, business users have enjoyed EngageMate’s© responsiveness and ease of use. Most users were able to pick up the navigation and use of the system after one self-guided training session. Everyone, both “Submitters” and “Reviewers”, receive', \"email notifications when an activity is ready for their action. The email provides an embedded hyperlink that takes users directly to the activity they need to take action on. Additionally, upon logging into EngageMate©, users are presented with a simple landing page showing tiles that separate activities into distinct categories allowing users to see a filtered list of activities to find any activity they are looking for expeditiously. It also includes customizable dashboards that pull information from the system in real-time to provide metrics for activities, service providers used, approvals, and close-out alerts.  Given the ever-changing nature of the life sciences industry and government reporting, flexibility is a top priority for all Cresen Solutions’ product offerings, including EngageMate©. It is easy to create and edit any of the system's forms and needs assessment qualifications from the user interface, including quickly changing language translations. In the most recent\", \"implementation of EngageMate©, the system is translated into Japanese, with the help of translation vendors and the users themselves. Cresen Solutions can accommodate changes or updates to the translations rapidly without downtime. Where EngageMate© shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented in the system without hardcoding and interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time.    Finally, any system must have flexibility in how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable.  This problem is compounded as the user pool grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. EngageMate© allows user profiles to be easily\", \"managed by an administrator to add and remove users, change their assigned department, grant access to specific forms, and change their role in the system. Reviewers, or the administrator on the Reviewer's behalf, can delegate their role to another Reviewer while out on leave.  This allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while they are out of the office.   In conclusion, EngageMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the engagement lifecycle. It allows for the management of the entire engagement process globally.

Additionally, the system has an automated workflow and email notification capability that eases the monitoring and remediation process of the company.    \\n Figure 1: Risk Monitoring Lifecycle.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nRisk management, auditing, and monitoring processes allow Life Science companies to conform with state and federal regulations while enabling them to also align with relevant internal policies and procedures. Within most companies, the global compliance department identifies potential risks through the execution of their ongoing monitoring process. Assessing the risk enables the organizations to identify weaknesses within the internal controls and identify policies and procedures that should be corrected. Companies can then take necessary corrective actions which ultimately can reduce the number of high-risk issues in the future. Additionally, the compliance department must monitor and document business events and interactions. Most companies lack flexibility and sophistication in identifying and mitigating their risk areas, monitoring, and auditing phases. The majority of these details are often tracked', 'through Excel sheets, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error. This manual tracking process becomes even more complex when the compliance teams are located across the globe in regions with varying international laws. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a refined system where companies can conduct a risk assessment, track monitoring, and remediation details, and easily assess the corrective measures. MonitorMate© is a refined system that seamlessly resolves many of the challenges associated within the risk monitoring lifecycle. Cresen Solutions prides itself on the satisfaction of our clients and the resulting associated improvements in business practices gained by switching from an outdated Excel-based approach to MonitorMate©. The system uses a simple question-based approach to evaluate global risk. The calculated risk value is then split into different ranges with corresponding colors which allows users to easily identify the activities with increased risk.', \"MonitorMate© supports single sign-on (SSO) and can also be integrated with different company source systems like an HR employee feed or a field-based sales roster Where MonitorMate© really shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented within the system without hardcoding and business interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a default value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time. MonitorMate© provides users with a comprehensive set of dashboards – accessible to all levels of the organization – to facilitate the real-time monitoring remediation and escalation of data captured within the system. For example, dynamic visuals such as heat maps are created with real-time data that helps the users to visualize\", '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ncolor-coded risk ratings to quickly identify risk severity. Dashboards, and sensitive or targeted information, can be aligned to different user roles created within the system, based on specific client requirements.  In many companies, compliance organizations can have large geographically dispersed structures with different roles and regions – within MonitorMate© we can customize the logic and associated dashboards to allow users restricted access to specific and relevant data for their regional and/or role assignments. Finally, any system must have the flexibility to support how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable. This problem is compounded as the user base grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. MonitorMate© allows user profiles to be easily managed by an administrator role.  Administrators can add', 'and remove users, limit the user to a specified region, change their assigned region, and change their role in the system. For example, a “monitor” role can assign an activity to multiple reviewers, which allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while a reviewer is out of the office. One of our recent clients had a specific business need that no other monitoring platform could effectively support. We developed a solution that catered to our client’s needs and allowed them to better capture their rep-ride monitoring data. This not only highlights MonitorMate’s© flexibility to accommodate specific business needs, but it ultimately resulted in a more sophisticated approach for capturing, analyzing, and identifying gaps in the field-based compliance monitoring process. In conclusion, MonitorMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the Risk Monitoring lifecycle. It is uniquely designed', 'to comprehensively assess, monitor, and evaluate global risk within a company.

Our organization has a clear focus and mission to enable improved business outcomes through advanced technology solutions and analytical expertise. The leadership team is comprised of seasoned healthcare industry experts focused on enabling the technological advancements necessary in today's ever-changing healthcare landscape. Strong foundations in technology systems and solutions and the business acumen to enable predictable business results are keys to our success. Experience, quality, and innovation are the cornerstones of our team's capabilities and are applied to each engagement. SpendMate© is a healthcare compliance transparency tool designed to streamline the end-to-end business process of transparency reporting.\", 'Like other offerings in the Cresen Solutions suite, SpendMate© was created in partnership with our life sciences and pharmaceutical customers. SpendMate© enables companies to meet the growing demand for transparency between industry and medical providers in the form of report preparation, generation, and submission, doing so cost-effectively, and it also easily scales with companies as they expand globally. Transparency reporting has complex requirements, SpendMate© excels in the way it enables healthcare companies to efficiently navigate these requirements. All healthcare companies engage with medical professionals and organizations for various events and other engagements. Transactions from these interactions can include a service fee for speaking at an event, reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, and more. By law, or code, these transactions must be reported in each country where applicable and be made publicly available. Since the governing body can change based on', 'the country or region, the reporting requirements also differ. Another layer of complexity includes intricate business rules that are used to evaluate which transactions are reportable or not. While these reports can be created manually, doing so can prove error prone and time-consuming for compliance teams. When dealing with large numbers of transactions, manually determining which are to be reported is both inefficient and is generally considered poor business practice.  SpendMate© simplifies the spend reporting process by providing the flexibility and scalability needed by our clients to meet the compliance demands of external entities. Recently, SpendMate’s© reporting module was successfully implemented at a top 10 pharmaceutical company, providing greater control and configurability over their previous reporting solution. SpendMate© provides efficiency in form and function by having a user-friendly interface that is driven by a configurable business logic engine. This provides the', 'ability to add or remove attributes and business rules at any time without impacting legacy data. The key versatility of SpendMate© lies within its fully customizable forms and templates, allowing Cresen Solutions to', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ntailor the data entry forms and reporting templates to align with the needs of each client. Using SpendMate’s© end-to-end process, data can be imported from various engagement management systems, processed, validated, and reported using the built-in reporting module.  When operating on a global scale across different countries, users and user permissions must be managed effectively. User roles within SpendMate© are broken into 3 categories, Administrative, Data Coordinator, and Data Entry. Administrative accounts have access to all data and functionalities within SpendMate© and also have the ability to perform system administration and configuration. Data-Coordinators can create and edit transactions and submit them for verification as well as generate country-specific spend reports. To add a layer of data security, Data Coordinators can be assigned to specific countries and will only have access to the', 'assigned country’s data and reports. Lastly, the Data Entry role can be assigned to vendors giving them access to specific forms to enter transactions for commercial and research engagements. Users and their roles can be quickly set up or adjusted by the admins, ensuring a quick transition during times of employee turnover. Below in Figure 1 is an architecture diagram that showcases the different aspects of SpendMate©. \\n Figure 1: SpendMate© Architecture Diagram One key area in which SpendMate© excels is through its various activity management system integrations, allowing SpendMate© to receive a constant flow of data in relation to new events and other engagements between healthcare companies and medical professionals and organizations. The data received from these activity management systems is then cleaned and transformed before being displayed. To streamline the user’s access to SpendMate©, single sign-on integrations are supported but not required. Users can review and validate', 'the data within SpendMate© and use its built-in reporting module to generate spend reports specific to each country.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nTo ensure the accuracy of medical professional and organization customer records, SpendMate© has a partnership with Veeva Open Data and can integrate with other third-party vendors that maintain customer reference data to match the unique customer profiles. SpendMate© can be configured to send a request to a client’s customer master using an API call, and the returned match responses will be displayed for the user to select the matching customer profile. Additionally, SpendMate© supports automatic matching of the customer profiles if certain unique identifiers are present, such as the NPI number or other local identifiers. If duplicate customer profiles exist, SpendMate© has the added functionality of merging and unmerging customers to address these issues. One of the key features of SpendMate© is its reporting module, which supports the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations', '(EFPIA) reports, European Local Law reports, and U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports, Patient Organization (PO) reports, and other country specific reports (Brazil, Colombia, etc.). Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways. For that reason, SpendMate© allows our clients to determine which interactions are reportable and not reportable through business rules using mappings at the country and report type level. The same approach is applied to professional types, for example, a nurse might be reportable in Norway, but not in Switzerland, this can be easily handled through the mapping configurations of each country. For the purposes of validation, a validation file is automatically generated along with each report, following the same input parameters selected on the UI. Within the validation file are two key columns; if the transaction is included on the report and if not, the reason why it is excluded. The validation file can be used to quickly determine why certain transactions are missing from the disclosure report based on the reasoning provided. Users can also quickly adjust the mapping configurations to rectify the issue, if needed.', 'SpendMate’s© reporting module can also generate reports in different currencies and various numeric formats. SpendMate© offers users the choice of prepending or appending a currency code to the amount as per their requirements. The size of compliance teams can vary, therefore, SpendMate© allows for the saving of generated reports within the application. Saved reports can be accessed by everyone on the compliance team thereby reducing the need to constantly regenerate new reports. Reports from prior years can be maintained within the tool and are available for any updates or if a refreshed report is needed. Lastly, SpendMate© has an extensive audit trail capability that includes archiving/audit information on who generated which report, when it was generated, what the', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ninput parameters were, et cetera, allowing the compliance team to keep track of historical information and effectively respond to audit and exception inquires. In conclusion, SpendMate© is designed to simplify compliance transparency reporting on a global scale by supporting healthcare companies through every step of the process. SpendMate’s© ability to adapt paired with its flexibility allows our clients to thrive in the ever-changing landscape of compliance reporting.

Biden, Jr., 2021 \\nAddress Before a Joint Session of the Congress \\nApril 28, 2021 \\nThe President.  Thank you. Thank you. Thank you. Good to be back. As Mitch and Chuck \\nwill un derstand , it's good to be almost home, down the hall. [ Laughter ] Anyway, thank you all.  \\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President —no President has ever said those words from this \\npodium. No President has ever said those words, and it's about time.  \\nFirst Lady —I'm her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; Members of the United \\nStates Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting \\ntonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different, a reminder of the extraordinary times \\nwe're in.  \\nThroughout our history, Presidents have come to this Chamber to speak to Congress, to the \\nNation , and to the world;  to declare war, to celebrate peace;  to announce new plans and \\npossibilities. Tonight I come to talk about crisis and\", \"opportunity, about rebuilding the N ation, \\nrevitalizing our democracy, and winning the future for America.  \\nI stand here tonight, 1  day shy of the hundred th day of my administration , hundred days \\nsince I took the oath of office and lifted my hand off our family Bible and inherited a N ation —we \\nall did —that was in crisis: the worst pandemic in a century , the worst economic crisis since the \\nGreat Depression , the worst attack on our democracy since the Civil War.  \\nNow, after just 100 days, I can report to the N ation: America is on the move again , turning \\nperil into possibility, crisis to opportunity, setback s into strength.  We all know life can knock us \\ndown. But , in America, we never, ever, ever stay down. Americans always get up. Today, that's \\nwhat we're doing: America is rising anew, choosing hope over fear, truth over lies, and light over \\ndarkness.  \\nAfter 100 days of rescue and renewal, America is ready for takeoff, in my view. We're \\nworking again, dreaming\", \"again, discovering again, and leading the world again.  We have shown \\neach other and the world that there's no quit in America —none.  \\nOne hundred days ago , America's house was on fire. And w e had to act. And thanks to the \\nextraordinary leadership of Speaker Pelosi; Majority Leader Schumer; and the overwhelming \\nsupport of the American people —Democrats, Independents, and Republicans —we did act.  \\nTogether we passed the American Rescue Plan , one of the most consequential rescue packages in \\nAmerican history. We're already seeing the results. [ Applause ] We're already seeing the results.  \\nAfter I promised we'd get 100 million COVID –19 vaccine shots into people's arms in 100 \\ndays, we will have provided over 220 million COVID shots in those 100 days. Thanks to all the help of all of you, we're marshaling—with your help, everyone's help —we're marshaling ev ery \\nFederal resource. We've gotten vaccines to nearly 40,000 pharmacies and over 700 c ommunity \\nhealth centers where the\", \"poorest of the poor can be reached. We're setting up community \\nvaccination sites, developing mobile units to get to hard-to -reach commun ities.  \\nToday, 90 percent of Americans now live within 5  miles of a vaccination site. Everyone over \\nthe age of 16 —everyone —is now eligible to get vaccinated right now, right away. Go get \\nvaccinated, America. Go and get the vaccination. They're available. Yo u're eligible now.  \\nWhen I was sworn in on January 20, less than 1 percent of the seniors in America were fully \\nvaccinated against COVID –19. One hundred days later, 70 percent of seniors i n America over 65\", '2 are protected —fully protected.  Senior deaths from COVID– 19 are down 80 percent since \\nJanuary —down 80 percent —because of all of you. And more than half of all the adults in \\nAmerica have gotten at least one shot.  \\nAt a mass vaccination center in Glendale, Arizona, I asked the  nurse —I said, \"What\\'s it \\nlike?\" She looked at me , and she said, \"It\\'s like every shot is giving a dose of hope\" —was her \\nphrase. \"A dose of hope.\"  \\nA dose of hope for an educator in Florida who has a child suffering from an autoimmune \\ndisease —wrote to me, said she\\'s worried —that she was worrying about bringing the virus home. \\nShe said she then got vaccinated at a large site, i n her car. She said she sat in her car, when she \\ngot vaccinated and just cried , cried out of joy and cried out of relief.  \\nParents seeing  the smiles on their kids\\' faces, for those who are able to go back to school \\nbecause the teachers and school bus drivers and cafeteria workers have been vaccinated.  \\nGrandparents', \"hugging their children and grandchildren instead of pressing hands against a \\nwindow to say goodbye.  It means everything. Those things mean e verything.  \\nYou know, there's still —you all know it; you know it better than any group of Americans —\\nthere's still more work to do to beat this virus. We can't let our guard down.  \\nBut tonig ht I can say it: Because of you, the American people, our progress these past \\nhundred days against one of the worst pandemics in history has been one of the greatest logistical \\nachievements —logistical achievements —this country has ever seen.  \\nWhat else have we done in those first hundred days?  \\nWe kept our commitment —Democrats and Republicans—of sending $1,400 rescue checks \\nto 85 percent of American households. We've already sent more than 160 million checks out the \\ndoor. It's making the difference. You all know it when you go home. For many people, it's making all the difference in the world.  \\nThe single mom in Texas who wrote to me, she said\", \"she couldn't work, but she said the relief \\ncheck put food on the table and saved her and her son from eviction from their apartment.  A \\ngrandmother in Virginia who told me she immediately took her granddaughter to the eye doctor , \\nsomething she said she put off for months because she didn't have the money.  \\nOne of the  defining images, at least from my perspective, in  this crisis has been cars lined \\nup, cars lined up for miles. And not people who just barely ever start those cars, nice cars lined up \\nfor miles, waiting for a box of food to be put in their trunk.  I don't know about you, but I didn't \\never think I'd see that in America. And all of this is through no fault of their own. No fault of their \\nown, these people are in this position.  \\nThat's why the Rescue Plan is delivering food and nutrition assistance to millions of \\nAmericans facing hunger, and hunger is down sharply already.  We're also providing rental \\nassistance—you all know this, but the American people, I want\", \"to make sure they understand —\\nkeeping people from being evicted from their homes, providing loans to small businesses to reopen and keep their employees on the job.  \\nDuring these 100 days, an additional 800,000 Americans enrolled in the Affordable Care Act \\nwhen I established the special signup period to do that —800,000 in that period.  We're making \\none of the largest one -time ever investments—ever —in improving health care for veterans. \\nCritical investments to address the opioid crisis. And, maybe most importantly, thanks to the American Rescue Plan, we're on track to cut child poverty in America in half this year.  \\nAnd, in the process, while this was all go ing on, the economy created more than 1,300,000 \\nnew jobs in 100 days , more jobs in the first 100 days than any President on record.  The\", '3 International Monetary Fund is now estimating our  economy will grow at a rate of more than 6 \\npercent this year. That will be the fastest pace of economic growth in this country in nearly four \\ndecades.  \\nAmerica is moving —moving forward—but we can\\'t stop now.  We\\'re in competition with \\nChina and other countries to win the 21st c entury. We\\'re at a great inflection point in history. We \\nhave to do more than just build back better —I mean , \"build back.\" We have to build back better. \\nWe have to compete more strenuous ly than we have.  \\nThroughout our history, if you think about it, public investment i n infrastructure has literally \\ntransformed America: our attitudes, as well as our opportunities.  The transconti nental railroad, \\nthe interstate highways united two oceans and brought a totally new age of progress to the United \\nStates of America.  Universal public schools and college aid opened wide the doors of \\nopportunity.  Scientific breakthroughs took us to the Moon—now we\\'re', \"on Mars—discovering \\nvaccines,  gave us the i nternet , and so much more.  \\nThese are the investments we made together as one country, and investments that only the \\nGovernment was in a position to make. Time and again, they propel us into the future.  That's why \\nI proposed the American Jobs Plan , a once-in -a-generation investment in America itself. This is \\nthe largest jobs plan since World War  II. It creates jobs to upgrade our transportation \\ninfrastructure; jobs modernizing our roads, bridges, highways; jobs building ports and airports, \\nrail corridors, transit lines. \\nIt's clean water. And, today, up to 10 million homes in America and more than 400,000 \\nschools and childcare centers have pipes with lead in them, including in drinking water , a clear \\nand present danger to our children's health.  \\nThe American Jobs Plan creates jobs replacing 100 percent of the N ation's lead pipes and \\nservice lines so every American can drink clean water. And , in the process, it will create\", \"thousands an d thousands of good- paying jobs. It creates jobs connecting every American with \\nhigh-speed internet, including 35 percent of the rural America that still doesn't have it.  This is \\ngoing t o help our kids and our businesses succeed in the 21st -century economy.  \\nAnd I 'm asking the Vice President to lead this effort, if she would ——  \\nVice President Kamala D. Harris. Of course.  \\nThe President.  ——because I know it will get done.  \\nIt creates jobs, building a modern power grid. Our grids are vulnerable to storms, hacks, \\ncatastrophic failures, with tragic results, as we saw in Texas and elsewhere during the winter \\nstorms.  The American Jobs Plan will create jobs that will lay thousands of miles of transmission \\nlines needed to build a re silient and fully clean grid. We can do that.  \\nLook, the American Jobs Plan will help millions of people get back to their jobs and back to \\ntheir careers.  Two million women have dropped out of the workforce during this pandemic —2\", \"million , and too often bec ause they couldn't get the care they needed to care for their child or care \\nfor an elderly parent who needs help.  \\nEight hundred thousand families are on a Medicare waiting list right now to g et homecare \\nfor their aging parent or loved one with a disability. If you think it's not important, check out in \\nyour own district , Democrat or Republican. Democrat or Republican voters, their great concern —\\nalmost as much as their children —is taking care o f an elderly loved one who can't be left alone. \\nMedicaid contemplated it, but this plan is going to help those families and create jobs for our \\ncaregivers with better wages and better benefits, continuing a cycle of growth.\", '4 For too long, we\\'ve failed to use the most important word when it comes to meeting the \\nclimate crisis: \"jobs.\" Jobs. Jobs. For me, when I think \"climate change,\" I think \"jobs.\"  \\nThe American Jobs Plan will put engineers and construction workers to work building more \\nenergy -efficient buildings and homes ; electrical workers—IBEW members —installing 500,000 \\ncharging stations along our highways so we can own the electric car market. Farmers —farmers \\nplanting cover cr ops so they can reduce the carbon dioxide in the air and get paid for doing it.  \\nLook, but think about it: There is simply no reason why the blades for wind turbines can\\'t be \\nbuilt in Pittsburgh instead of Beijing. No reason. None. No reason. So, folks, there\\'s no reason \\nwhy American workers can\\'t lead the world in the production of electric vehicles and batteries. I \\nmean, there is no reason. We have this capacit y. We have the brightest, best  trained people in the \\nworld.  \\nThe American Jobs Plan is going to', 'create millions of good-paying jobs —jobs Americans \\ncan raise a family on —as my dad would t hen say, \"with a little breathing room.\"  And all the \\ninvestments in the American Jobs Plan will be guided by one principle: b uy American. Buy \\nAmerican.  And I might note, parenthetically , that does not violate any trade agreement. It\\'s been \\nthe law since the thirties : buy American.  \\nAmerican tax dollars are going to be used to buy American products made in Americ a to \\ncreate American jobs. That\\'s the way it\\'s supposed to be and it will be in this administration. And \\nI made it clear to all my Cabinet people. Their ability to give exemptions has been strenuously \\nlimited. It will be American products. \\nNow I know some of you at home are wondering whether these jobs are for you. So many of \\nyou—so many of the folks I grew up with—feel left behind, forgotten in an economy that\\'s so \\nrapidly changing i t\\'s frightening.  I want to speak directly to you. Because if you think about it,', 'that\\'s what people are most worried about: \"Can I fit in?\"  \\nIndependent experts estimate the American Jobs Plan will add millions of jobs and trillions \\nof dollars to economic growth in the years to come. It is an 8 -year program. These are good -\\npaying jobs that can\\'t be outsourced.  \\nNearly 90 percent of the infrastructure jobs created in the American Jobs Plan do not require \\na college degree; 75 percent don\\'t require an associate\\'s degree.  The American Jobs Plan is a blue-\\ncollar blueprint to build America. That\\'s what it is.  \\nAnd it recognizes something I\\'v e always said in this Chamber and the other. Good guys and \\nwomen on Wall Street, but Wall Street didn\\'t build this country. The middle class built the country, and unions built the middle class. So that\\'s why I\\'m calling on Congress to pass the \\nProtect the Right to Organize Act —the PRO Act —and send it to my desk so we can support the \\nright to unionize.  \\nAnd by the way, while you\\'re thinking about sending things to my', \"desk—[ laughter ]—let's \\nraise the minimum wage to $15. No one —no one working 40 hours a week—no one working 40 \\nhours a week should live below  the poverty line.  \\nWe need to ensure greater equity and opportunity for women. And while we're doing this, \\nlet's get the Paych eck Fairness Act to my desk as well —equal pay. It's been much too long. And \\nif you're wondering whether it's too long, look behind me.  \\nAnd finally, the American Jobs Plan will be the biggest increase in nondefense research and \\ndevelopment on record. We will see more technological change— and some of you know more \\nabout this than I do—we'll see more technological change in the next 10 years than we saw in the \\nlast 50. That's how rapidly artificial intelligence and so much more is changing.\", \"5 And we're falling behind the competition with the rest of the world.  Decades ago, we used to \\ninvest 2 pe rcent of our gross domestic product in America —2 percent of our gross domestic \\nproduct —in research and development.  \\nToday, Mr. Secretary, that's less than 1 percent. Ch ina and other countries are closing in fast. \\nWe have to develop and dominate the products and technologies of the future: advanced batteries, \\nbiotechnology, computer chips, clean energy.  \\nThe Secretary of Defense can tell you —and those of you on—who work on national security \\nissues know—the Defense Department has an agency called DARPA—the Defense Advanced \\nResearch Project Agency. The people who set up before I came here —and that's been a long time \\nago—to develop breakthroughs that enhance our national security—that's their only job. And it's \\na semiseparate agency; it's under the Defense Department. It's led to everything from the \\ndiscovery of the internet  to GPS and so much more that 's enhanced\", \"our security.  \\nThe National Institute of Health —the NIH—I believe, should create a similar Advanced \\nResearch Projects Agency for Health. And that would —here's what it would do. It would have a \\nsingular purpose: to develop breakthroughs to prevent, detect, and treat diseases like Alzheimer's, \\ndiabetes, and cancer.  \\nI'll still never forget when we passed the cancer proposal the last year I was Vice President —\\nalmost $9 million going to NIH. And if you excuse the point of personal privilege, I'll ne ver \\nforget you standing , Mitch, and saying you'd name it after my deceased son. It meant a lot.  \\nBut so many of us have deceased sons, daughters, and relatives who di ed of cancer. I can \\nthink of no more worthy investment. I know of nothing that is more bipartisan. So let's end cancer \\nas we know it. It's within our power. It's within our power to do it.  \\nInvestments in jobs and infrastructure, like the ones we're talking about, have often had \\nbipartisan support in the past. Vice\", \"President Harris and I met regularly in the Oval Office with \\nDemocrats and Republicans to discuss the Jobs Plan. And I applaud a group of Republican \\nSenators who just put forward their own proposal.  \\nSo let's get to work. I wanted to lay out, before the Congress, my plan before we got into the \\ndeep discussions. I'd like to meet with those who have ideas that are different —they think are \\nbetter. I welcome those ideas.  \\nBut the rest of the world is not waiting for us. I just want to be clear: From my perspective, \\ndoing nothing is not an option. Look, we can't be so busy competing with one another that we \\nforget the competition  that we have with the rest of the world to win t he 21st century.  \\nSecretary Blinken can tell you, I spent a lot of time with President Xi: traveled over 17,000 \\nmiles with him; spent, they tell me, over 24 hours in private discussions with him. When he called \\nto congratulate me, we had a 2 -hour discussion. He's deadly earnest about becoming the most\", \"significant, consequential nation in the world. He and others —autoc rats—think that democracy \\ncan't compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus.  \\nTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once -in-a-\\ngeneration investment in our families and our children. That's why I've introduced the American \\nFamilies Plan tonight, which addresses four of the biggest challenges facing American families and, in turn, America.  \\nFirst is access to a good education. When this N ation made 12 years of public education \\nuniversal in the last century, it made us the best  educated, best  prepared Nation in the world. It's, I \\nbelieve, the overwhelming reason that propelled us to where we got in the 21st —in the 20th \\ncentury.\", '6 But the world has caught up, or catching up. They are not waiting. I would say, \\nparenthetically: If we were sitting down, put a bipartisan committee together and said, \"Okay, \\nwe\\'re going to deci de what we do in terms of g overnment providing for free education,\" I wonder \\nwhether we\\'d think, as we did in the 20th century, that 12 years is enough in the 21st century. I \\ndoubt it. Twelve years is no longer enough today to compete with the rest of the world in the 21st \\ncentury.  That\\'s why my American Families Plan guarantees 4  additional years of public education \\nfor every person in America, starting as early as we can.  \\nThe great universiti es of this country have conducted studies over the last 10 years. It shows \\nthat adding 2 years of universal high -quality preschool for every 3 -year -old and 4 -year-old, no \\nmatter what background they come from, it puts them in the position to be able to compete all the \\nway through 12 years. It increases exponentially their prospect of', 'graduating and going on \\nbeyond graduation.  The research shows when a young child goes to school —not daycare—they \\nare far mor e likely to graduate from high school and go to college or something after high school.  \\nWhen you add 2 years of free community college on top of that, you begin to change the \\ndynami c. We can do that.  \\nAnd we\\'ll increase Pell Grants and invest in Historical Black Colleges and Universities, \\nTribal Colleges, Minority -Serving Institutions. The reason is: They don\\'t have the endowments, \\nbut their students are just as capable of learning about cybersecurity, just as capable of learning about metallurgy —all the things that are going on that provide those jobs of the future.  \\nJill is a community co llege professor who teaches today as First Lady. She\\' s long said —if \\nI\\'ve heard it once, I\\'ve heard it a thousand times: \"Joe, any country that outeducates us is going to \\noutcompete us.\" She\\'ll be deeply involved in leading this effort. Thank you, Jill.', \"Second thing we need: American Families Plan will provide access to quality, affordable \\nchildcare. We guarantee—and I'm proposing a legislation to guarantee that low - and middle -\\nincome families will pay no more than 7 percent of their income for high-quality care for children \\nup to the age of 5. The most hard-pressed working families won't have to spend a dime.  \\nThird, the American Families Plan will finally pr ovide up to 12 weeks of paid leave and \\nmedical leave —family and medical leave. We're one of the few industrial countries in the world . \\nNo one should have to choose between a job and paycheck or taking care of themselves and their \\nloved ones —a parent, a spouse, or child.  \\nAnd fourth, the American Family Plan puts directly into the pockets of millions of \\nAmericans. In March, we expanded a tax credit for ever y child in a family. Up to $3,000 per \\nchild, if they're under 6  years of age—I mean, excuse me—under —over [under ]\\n* 6 years of age, \\nand $3,600 for\", \"children over 6  years of age.  \\nWith two parents, two kids, that's $7,200 in the pockets that's going to help to take care of \\nyour family. And that will help more than 65 million children and help cut childcare [child ]* \\npoverty in half. And we can afford it.  So we did that in the last piece of legislation we passed. But \\nlet's extend that c hildcare tax credit at least through the end of 2025.  \\nThe American Rescue Plan lowered health  care premiums for 9 million Americans who buy \\ntheir coverage under the Affordable Care Act. I know that's really popular on this side of the \\naisle. [Laughter ] But let's make that provision permanent so their premiums don't go back up.  \\nIn addition to my Families Plan, I'm going to work with Congress to address, this year, other \\ncritical priorities for American families. The Affordable Care Act has been a lifeline for millions \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"7 of Americans, protecting people with preexisting conditions, protecting women's health. And the \\npandemic has demonstrated how badly —how badly—it's needed. Let's lower deductibles for \\nworking families on the Affordable Care —in the Affordable Care Act. And let's lower \\nprescription drug costs.  \\nWe know how to do this. The last President had that as an objective. We all know how \\noutrageously expensive drugs are in America.  In fact, we pay the highest prescription drug prices \\nof anywhere in the world right here in America —nearly three times —for the same drug, nearly \\nthree times what other countries pay. We have to change that, and we can.  \\nLet's do what we've always talked about for all the years I was down here in this body —in \\nCongress. Let's give Medicare the power to save hundreds of billions of dollars by negotiating lower drug prescription prices. And by the way, i t won't just help people on Medicare,  it will \\nlower prescription drug costs for everyone.  \\nAnd the\", \"money we save, which is bill ions of dollars, can go to strengthen the Affordable \\nCare Act and expand Medicare coverage benefits without costing taxpayers an additional penny. \\nIt's within our power to do it; let's do it now. We've talked about it long enough. Democrats and \\nRepublicans , let's get it done this year. This is all about a simple premise: Health  care should be a \\nright  and not a privilege in America.  \\nSo how do we pay for my Jobs and Family Plan? I made it clear, we can do it without \\nincreasing the deficits. Let's start with what I will not do: I will not impose any tax increase on \\npeople making less than $400,000. It's —but it's time for corporate America and the wealthiest 1 \\npercent of Americans to just begin to pay their fair shar e. Just their fair share.  \\nSometimes , I have arguments with my friends in the Democratic Party. I think you should be \\nable to become a billionaire and a millionaire, but pay your fair share.  \\nA recent study shows that 55 of the\", \"nation's biggest corporations paid zero Federal tax last \\nyear. Those 55 corporations made in excess of $40 billion in profit. A lot of companies also evade \\ntaxes through ta x havens in Switzerland and Bermuda and the Cayman Islands. And they benefit \\nfrom tax loopholes and deductions for offshoring jobs and shifting profits overseas. It's not right.  \\nWe're going to reform corporate taxes so they pay their fair share and help pa y for the public \\ninvestments their businesses will benefit from as well. And w e're going to reward work, not just \\nwealth. We take the top tax bracket for the wealthiest 1 percent of Americans— those making \\nover $400,000 or more —back up to where it was when George W. Bush was President when he \\nstarted: 39.6 percent. That's where it was when George W. was President.  \\nWe're going to get rid of the loopholes that allow Americans who make more than a million \\ndollars a year and pay a lower tax rate on their capital gains than Americans who receive a\", 'paycheck. We\\'re only going to affect three -tenths of 1 percent of all Americans by tha t action —\\nthree-tenths of 1 percent.  And the IRS is going to crack down on millionaires and billionaires \\nwho cheat on their taxes. It\\'s estimated to be billions of dollars by think tanks that ar e left, right, \\nand center.  \\nI\\'m not looking to punish anybody. But I will not add a tax burden—additional tax burden to \\nthe middle class in this country. They\\'re already paying enough. I believe what I propose is fair , \\nfiscally responsible, and it raises revenue to pay for the plans I have proposed and will create millions of jobs that will grow the economy and enhance our financial standing in the country.  \\nWhen you hear someone say that they don\\'t want to raise taxes on the wealthiest 1 percent or \\ncorporate America, ask them: \"Whose taxes you want to raise instead? Whose are you going to \\ncut?\"', '8 Look, the big tax cut of 2017, remember, it was supposed to pay for itself —that was how it \\nwas sold —and generate vast economic growth. Instead, it added $2 trillion to the deficit. It was a \\nhuge windfall for corporate America and those at the very top.  \\nInstead of using the tax saving to rai se wages and invest in research and development, it \\npoured billions of dollars into the pockets of CEOs. In fact, the pay gap between CEOs and their \\nworkers is now among the largest in history.  According to one study, CEOs make 320 times what \\nthe average w orker in their corporation makes. It used to be in the —below a hundred.  \\nThe pandemic has only made things worse. Twenty million Americans lost their job in the \\npandemic : working and middle  class Americans. At the same time, roughly 650 billionaires in \\nAmerica saw their net worth increase by more than $1 trillion , in the same exact period. Let me \\nsay it again: 650 people increased their wealth by more than $1 trillion during', 'this pande mic. And \\nthey\\'re now worth more than $4 trillion.  \\nMy fellow Americans, trickle-down—trickle -down—economics has never worked , and it\\'s \\ntime to grow the economy from the bottom and the middle out. Yo u know, there\\'s a broad \\nconsensus of economists— left, right, center —and they agree what I\\'m proposing will help create \\nmillions of jobs and generate historic economic growth. These are among the highest  value \\ninvestments we can make as a Nation. \\nI\\'ve often said: Our greatest strength is the power of our example, not just the example of our \\npower.  In my conversations with world leaders— and I\\'ve spoken to over 38, 40 of them now —\\nI\\'ve made it known—I\\'ve made it known—that America is back. And you know what they say? \\nThe comment that I hear most of all from them is they say : \"We see America is back , but for how \\nlong? But for how long?\"  \\nMy fellow Americans, we have to show not just that we\\'re back, but that we\\'re back to stay \\nand that we aren\\'t going to go it', \"alone. We're going to do it by leading with our allies. No one \\nnation can deal with all the crises of our time—from te rrorism, to nuclear proliferation, mass \\nmigration, cybersecurity, climate change, as well  as experi encing —what we're experiencing now \\nwith pandemics.  \\nThere's no wall high enough to keep any virus out. And our own vaccine supply , as it grows \\nto meet our nee ds—and we're meeting them —will become an arsenal f or vaccines for other \\ncountries, just as America was the ars enal of democracy for the world  and, in consequence, \\ninfluenced the world.  \\nBut every American will have access before that occur s—every American will have acce ss \\nto be fully covered by COVID– 19 from the vaccines we have.  \\nLook, the climate crisis is not our fight alone , it's a global fi ght. The United States accounts, \\nas all of you know, less than 15 percent of carbon emissions. The rest of the world accounts for \\n85 percent. That's why I kept my commitment to rejoin the Paris accord\", \"—because if we do \\neverything perfectly, it's not going to ultimately matter. \\nI kept my commitment to convene a climate summit right here in America with all of the \\nmajor economies of the world—China, Russia, India, the European Union—and I said I'd do it in \\nmy firs t hundred days.  \\nI want to be very blunt about it: I had— my attempt was to make sure that the world could \\nsee there was a consensus, that we are at an inflection point in history. And consensus—the \\nconsensus is: If we act to save the planet, we can create millions of jobs and economic growth \\nand opportunity to raise the standard of living to almost everyone around the world.  If you've \\nwatched any of it —and you were all busy; I'm sure you didn't have much time —that's what \\nvirtually every nation said, even the ones that aren't doing their fair share.\", '9 The investments I\\'ve proposed tonight also advance the foreign policy, in my view, that \\nbenefits the middle class. That means making sure every nation plays by the same rules in the \\nglobal economy, including China.  \\nMy discussions—in my discussions with President Xi, I told him, \"We welcome the \\ncompetition. We\\'re not looking for conflict.\" But I made absolutely clear that we will defend America\\'s interests across the board. America will stand up to unfair trade practices that undercut American workers and American industries, like subsidies from state—to state -owned operations \\nand enterprises and the theft of American technology and intellectual property.  \\nI also told President Xi that we\\'ll maintain a strong military presence in the Indo -Pacific, just \\nas we do with NATO in Europe, not to start a conflict, but to prevent one. I told him what I\\'ve \\nsaid to many world leaders: that America will not back away from our commitments—our commitment to human rights and fundamental', \"freedoms and to our alliances.  \\nAnd I pointed out to him: No responsible American President could remain silent when basic \\nhuman rights are being so blatantly violated. An American President has to represent the essence of what our country stands for. America is an idea, the most unique idea in history: We are \\ncreated, all of us, equal. It's who we are, and we cannot walk away from that principle and, in fact, say we're dealing with the American idea.  \\nWith regard to Russia, I know it concerns some of you, but I  made very clear to Putin th at \\nwe're not going to seek—excuse me —escalation, but their actions will have consequence if they \\nturn out to be true. And they turned out to be true , so I responded directly and proportionally to \\nRussia's interference in our elections and the cyber  attacks on our G overnment and our business. \\nThey did both of these things, and I told them we would respond, and we have.  \\nBut we can also cooperate when it's in our mutual interest. We did\", \"it when we extended the \\nNew START Treaty on nuclear arms, and we're working to do it on climate change. But he \\nunderstands we will  respond.  \\nOn Iran and North Korea—nuclear programs that present serious threats to American \\nsecurity and the security of the world —we're going to be working closely with our allies to \\naddress the threats posed by bot h of these countries through diplomacy, as well as stern \\ndeterrence.  \\nAnd American leadership means ending the fore ver war in Afghanistan. We have, without \\nhyperbole, the greatest fighting force in the history of the world. I'm the first President in 40 years who knows what it means to have a son serving in a war  zone.  Today , we have servicemembers \\nserving in the same war  zone as their parents did. We have servicemembers in Afghanistan who \\nwere not yet born on 9/11.  \\nThe war in Afghanistan, as we remember the debates here, were never meant to be \\nmultigenerational undert akings of nation -building. We went to Afghanistan to\", \"get terrorists —the \\nterrorists who attacked us on 9/11 —and we said we would follow Usama bin Laden to the gates \\nof hell to do it. If you've been to the upper Kunar Valley, you've kind of seen the gates of hell. \\nAnd we delivered justice to bin Laden. We degraded the terrorist threat of A l Qai da in \\nAfghanistan. And after 20 years of value—valor and sacrifice, it's time to bring those troops \\nhome.  \\nLook, even as we do, we will maintain an over -the-horizon capacity to suppress future \\nthreats to the homeland. And make no mistake: In 20 years, terrorists has—terrorism has metastasized. The threat has evolved way beyond Afghanistan. And those of you in the \\nintelligence committees, the foreign relations committee, the defense committees, you know well: We have to remain vigilant against the threats to the United States wherever they come from. Al\", '10 Qaida and ISIS are in Yemen, Syria, Somalia, other places in Africa, the Middle East, and \\nbeyond.  \\nAnd we won\\'t ignore what our intelligence agencies have determined to be the most lethal \\nterrorist threat to the homeland today: White supremacy is terrorism. We\\'re not going to ignore \\nthat either. \\nMy fellow Americans, look, we have to come together to heal the soul of this N ation . It was \\nnearly a year ago, before her father\\'s funeral, when I spoke with Gianna Floyd, George Floyd\\'s young daughter. She\\'s a little tyke, so I was kneeling down to talk to her so I could look her in the \\neye. And she looked at  me and she said, \"My daddy changed the world.\" Well, after the \\nconviction of George Floyd\\'s murderer, we can see how right she was if we have the courage to \\nact as a Congress.  \\nWe\\'ve all seen the knee of injustice on the neck of Black Americans. Now is our opportunity \\nto make some real progress. The vast majority of men and women wearing the uniform and a badge serve our', \"communities, and they serve them honorably.  I know them. I know they want to \\nhelp meet this moment as well.  \\nMy fellow Americans, we have to come together to rebuild trust between law enforcement \\nand the people they serve, to root out systemic racism in our criminal justice system, and to enact \\npolice reform in George Floyd's name that passed the House already.  I know Republicans have \\ntheir own ideas and are engaged in the very productive discussions with Democrats in the Senate. We need to work together to find a consensus. But let's get it done next month, by the first \\nanniversary of George Floyd's death.  \\nThe country supports this reform, and Congress should act —should act. We have a giant \\nopportunity to bend to the arc of the moral universe towards justice —real justice. And with the \\nplans outlined tonight, we have a real chance to root out systemic racism that plagues America \\nand American lives in other ways; a chance to deliver real equity —good jobs, good schools,\", \"affordable housing, clean air, clean water, being able to generate wealth and pass it down two \\ngenerations because you have an access to purchase a house. Real opportunities in the lives of \\nmore Americans: Black, White, Latino, Asian Americans, Native Americans.  \\nLook, I also want to thank the United States Senate for v oting 94 to 1 to pass the COVID –19 \\nHate Crimes Act to protect Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders. You acted decisively. And \\nyou can see on television the viciousness of the hate crimes we've seen over the past year —this \\npast year and for too long. I urge the House to do the same and send that legislation to my desk, \\nwhich I will gladly, anxiously sign.  \\nI also hope Congress can get to my desk the Equality Act to protect LGBTQ Americans. To \\nall transgender Americans watching at home, especially young people who are so brave, I want \\nyou to know your President has your back.  \\nAnother thing: Let's authorize the Violence Against Women Act, which has been law\", 'for 27 \\nyears. Twenty -seven years ago, I wrote it. It  will close the —the act that has to be authori zed now \\nwill close the \"boyfriend\" loophole to keep guns out of the hands of abusers. The court order said:  \\n\"This is an abuser. You can\\'t own a gun.\" It\\'s to close that loophole that existed.  You know, it\\'s \\nestimated that 50 women are shot and killed by an intimate partner every month in America— 50 \\na month. Let\\'s pass it and save some lives.  \\nAnd I need not tell anyone this, but gun violence is becoming an epidemic in America.  The \\nflag at the White House was still flying at half -mast for the 8 victims in the mass shooting in \\nGeorgia when 10 more lives were taken in a mass shooting in Colorado.  And, in the week in', '11 between those two events, 250 other Americans were shot dead in the streets of America—250 \\nshot dead.  \\nI know how hard it is to make progress on this issue. In the ninetie s, we passed universal \\nbackground checks, a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines that hold 100 rounds \\nthat can be fired off in seconds. We beat the NRA. Mass shootings and gun violence declined. \\nCheck out the report over  10 years. But  in the early twenty —2000s, the law expired, and we\\'ve \\nseen daily bloodshed since. I\\'m not saying if the law continued, we wouldn\\'t see bloodshed.  \\nMore than 2  weeks ago in the Rose Garden, surrounded by some of the bravest people I \\nknow —the survivors and f amilies who lost loved ones to gun violence —I laid out several  of the \\nDepartment of Justice actions that are being taken to  impact on this epidemic.  \\nOne of them is banning so- called \"ghost guns.\" The se are homemade guns built from a kit \\nthat includes directions on how to finish the firearm. The', \"parts have no serial numbers, so they \\nshow up at crime scenes,  and they can't be traced. The buyers of these ghost gun kits aren't \\nrequired to pass any background check. Anyone, from a criminal or terrorist, could buy this kit \\nand, within 30 minutes , have a weapon that's lethal. But no more.  \\nAnd I will do everything in my power to protect the American peop le from this epidemic of \\ngun violence, but it's time for Congress to act as well. Look, I don't want to become confrontational , but we need more Senate Republicans to join the overwhelming majority of \\nDemocrat ic colleagues and close the loopholes requiring a background check on purchases of \\nguns. We need a ban on assault weapons and high-capacity magazines. And don't tell me it can't \\nbe done. We did it before, and it worked.  \\nTalk to most responsible gun owners and hunters. They'll tell you there's no possible \\njustification for having 100 rounds in a weapon. What do you think: deer are wearing Kevlar \\nvests? [Laughter\", '] No, what\\'s —they\\'ll tell you that there are too many people today who are able \\nto buy a gun,  but shouldn\\'t be able to buy a gun.  \\nThese kinds of reasonable reforms have overwhelming support from the American people, \\nincluding many gun owners. The country supports reform and is —and Congress should act.  \\nThis shouldn\\'t be a red or blue issue. An d no amendment to the Constitution is absolute. You \\ncan\\'t yell \"Fire!\" in a crowded theater. From the very beginning, there were certain guns, \\nweapons, that could not be owned by Americans. Certain people could not own those weapons \\never.  We\\'re not changing the Constitution; we\\'re being reasonable. I think this is not a Democrat \\nor Republican issue , I think it\\'s an American issue.  \\nAnd here\\'s what else we can do: Immigration has always been essential to Amer ica. Let\\'s \\nend our exhausting war over immigration. For more than 30 years, politicians have talked about immigration reform, and we\\'ve done nothing about it. It\\'s time to fix', \"it.  \\nOn day one of my P residency, I kept my commitment and sent a comprehensive immigration \\nbill to the United States Congress. If you believe we need to secure the border, pass it, because it has a lot of money for  high-tech border security. If you believe in a pathway to citizenship, pass it \\nso over 11 million undocumented folks —the vast majority are here overstaying visas. Pass it. We \\ncan actually —if you actually want to solve a problem, I've sent a bill to —so take a close look at \\nit. \\nWe have to —also have to get at the root problem of why people are fleeing, particularly to —\\nto our southern border from Guatemala, Honduras, and El Salvador: the violence, the corruption, \\nthe gangs, and the political instability, hunger, hurricanes, earthquakes, natural disasters.  \\nWhen I was President, my President —when I was Vice President, the President asked me to \\nfocus on provi ding the help needed to address the root causes of migration. And it helped keep\", '12 people in their own countries instead of being forced to leave. The plan was working, but the last \\nadministration decided it was not worth it. I\\'m restoring the program and as ked Vice President \\nHarris to lead our diplomatic effort to take care of this. I have absolute confidence she\\'ll get the job done.  \\nNow, look, if you don\\'t like my plan, le t\\'s at least pass what we all agree on. Congress needs \\nto pass legislation this year to finally secure protection for \"dream ers,\" the young peopl e who \\nhave only known America as their home. And permanent protection for immigrants who are here on temporary protected status who came from countries beset by manmade and natural -made —\\nviolence and disaster. As well as a pathway to citizenship for farmworkers who put food on our \\ntables.  \\nLook, immigrants have done so much for America during this pandemic and throughout our \\nhistory. The country supports immigration reform. We should act. Let\\'s argue over it, let\\'s debate \\nit, but let\\'s', \"act.  \\nAnd if we truly want to restore the soul of America,  we need to protect the sacred right to \\nvote. Most people —more people voted in the last P residential election than any time in American \\nhistory, in the middle of the worst pandemic ever. It should be celebra ted. Instead, it's being \\nattacked.  Congress should pass H.R. 1 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act and send it to my \\ndesk right away. The country supports it. The Congress should act now.   \\nLook, in closing, as we gather here tonight, the images of a violent mob assaulting this \\nCapitol, desecrating our democracy, remain vivid in all our minds.  Lives were put at risk —many \\nof your lives. Lives were lost. Extraordinary courage was summoned. The insurrecti on was an \\nexistential crisis, a test of whether our democracy could survive. And it did.  \\nBut the struggle is far from over. The question of whether our democracy will long endure is \\nboth ancient and urgent, as old as our Republic , still vital today. Can our\", \"democracy deliver on its \\npromise that all of us, created equal in the image of God, have a chance to lead lives of dignity, respect, and possibility?  Can our de mocracy deliver the most —to the most pressing needs of our \\npeople?  Can our democracy overcome the lies, anger, hate, and fears that have pulled us apart? \\nAmerica's adversaries —the autocrats of the world —are betting we can't. And I promise you, \\nthey're bett ing we can't. They believe we're too full of anger and division and rage.  They look at \\nthe images of the mob that assaulted the Capitol as proof that the sun is setting on American democracy. But they are wrong. You know it; I know it. But we have to prove them wrong.  \\nWe have to prove democracy still works , that our G overnment still works and we can deliver \\nfor our people.  In our first hundred days together, we've acted to r estore the people's faith in \\ndemocracy to deliver. We're vaccinating the N ation. We're creating hundreds of thousands of new \\njobs.\", 'We\\'re delivering real results to people; they can see it and feel it in their own lives.  \\nOpening doors of opportunity, guaranteeing some more fairness and justice, that\\'s the \\nessence of America. That\\'s democracy in action.  Our Constitution opens with the words —as trite \\nas it sounds —\"We the People\". Well, it\\'s time to remember that \"We the People\" are the \\nGovernment —you and I. Not some force in a distant capital. Not some powerful force that we \\nhave no control over. It\\'s us. It\\'s \"We the People.\"  \\nIn another era when our democracy was tested, Franklin Roosevelt reminded us, \"In \\nAmerica, we do our part.\" We all do our part. That\\'s a ll I\\'m asking: that we do our part, all of us. \\nIf we do that, we will meet the center challenge of the age by proving that democracy is durable and strong. Autocrats will not win the future. We will. America will. And the future belongs to \\nAmerica.', '13 As I st and here tonight before you, in a new and vital hour of life and democracy of our \\nNation, and I can say with absolute confidence: I have never been more confident or optimistic \\nabout America , not because I\\'m President, because what\\'s happening with the American people.  \\nWe have stared into the abyss of insurrection and autocracy, pandemic and pain, and \"We \\nthe People\" did not flinch.  At the very moment our adversaries were certain we would pull apart \\nand fail, we came together. We united.  With light and hope, we summoned a new strength, new \\nresolve to position us to win the competition of the 21st century, on our way to a union more \\nperfect, more prosperous, and more just, as one people, one  Nation, and one America.  \\nFolks, as I told every world leader I\\'ve ever met with over the years, it\\'s never ever, ever \\nbeen a good bet to bet against America, and it still isn\\'t.  \\nWe are the United States of America. There is not a single thing —nothing—not hing beyond \\nour', \"capacity. We can do whatever we set our mind to do if we do it together. So let's begin to get together.  \\nGod bless you all, and may God protect our troops. Thank you for your patience.  \\nN\\nOTE: The President spoke at 9:0 6 p.m. in the House C hamber of the U.S. Capitol. In his \\nremarks, he referred to Se nate Minority Leader  A.

Biden, Jr., 2022 \\nAddress Before a Joint Session of the Congress on the State of the Union  \\nMarc h 1, 2022 \\nThe President.  Thank you all very , very much. Thank you, please. Thank you so much. \\nMadam  Speaker,  Madam Vice President, and our First Lady  and Second  Gentleman,  Members  of \\nCongress  and the Cabinet,  Justices of the Supreme  Court,  my fellow  Americans:  Last year,  \\nCOVID– 19 kept us apart . This year,  we're finally  together  again.   \\nTonight  we meet  as Democrats,  Republicans,  and Independents,  but most  importantly, as \\nAmericans with a duty to one another , to America,  to the American  people,  and to the \\nConstitution, and an unwavering  resolve that freedom  will always triumph  over tyranny.  \\nSix—[applause ]—thank you. Six days ago, Russia's  Vladimir  Putin  sought  to shake  the very \\nfoundations  of the free world,  thinking he could make  it bend to his menacing  ways. But he badly  \\nmiscalculated . He thought  he\", 'could roll into Ukrain e and the world  would roll over. Instead,  he \\nmet with a wall of strength  he never  anticipated  or imagined . He met the Ukrainian  people .  \\nFrom  President Zelensk iy, their —to every  Ukrainian,  their fearlessness,  their courage,  their \\ndetermination  literally  inspires  the world . Groups  of citizens blocking tanks  with their bodies . \\nEveryone  from  students  to retirees,  to teachers turned soldiers defending  their homeland.  And in \\nthis struggle —President  Zelensk iy said in his speech  to the European  Parliament, \"Light will win \\nover darkness. \" \\nThe Ukrainian  Amba ssador  to the United  States  is here tonight  sitting  with the First Lady . \\nLet each of us, if you\\'re able to stand,  stand  and send an unmistakable  signal  to the world  and \\nUkraine. Thank you. Thank  you, thank  you, thank you. She\\'s bright, she\\'s strong,  and she\\'s \\nresolved . Yes. We, the United  States  of America,  stand  with the Ukrainian  people.  \\nThroughout', \"our history,  we've learned  this lesson:  When  dictators  do not pay a price  for their \\naggression,  they cause more  chaos;  they keep  moving;  and the costs,  the threats to the America—\\nand America,  to the world  keeps rising. That's why the NATO alliance  was created:  to secure \\npeace and stability  in Europe  after World  War II. The United  States is a member,  along with 29 \\nother  nations . It matters. American  diplomacy  matters . American  resolve  matters.  \\nPutin 's latest  attack  on Ukraine was premeditated  and totally  unprovoked. He rejected  \\nrepeated —repeated —efforts  at diplomacy.  He thought  the West and NATO wouldn' t respond . He \\nthought  he could  divide  us at home,  in this Chamber,  in this Nation . He thought  he could divide  \\nus in Europe  as well.   \\nBut Putin  was wrong. We are ready . We are united . And that's what  we did: We stayed  \\nunited.  We prepared  extensively  and carefully . We spent  months  building  coalitions  of other\", \"freedom -loving nations  in Europe  and the Americas to—from  America to the Asian  and African  \\ncontinents  to confront  Putin.  \\nLike many  of you, I spent  countless hours  unifying  our European allies. We shared  with the \\nworld  in advance  what  we knew  Putin  was planning and precisely  how he would try to falsif y and \\njustify  his aggression.  We countered  Russia 's lies with the truth . And now—now  that he's acted,  \\nthe free world  is holding him accountable,  along with 27 members  of the European  Union—\\nincluding  France,  Germany,  Italy—as well as countries  like the United  Kingdom,  Canada,  Japan,  \\nKorea,  Australia,  New Zealand,  and many  others —even Switzerland —are inflicting  pain on \\nRussia and supporting the people  of Ukraine.  Putin  is now isolated  from  the world  more  than he \\nhas ever been.\", \"2 Together,  along  with our allies,  we are right  now enforcing  powerful  economic  sanctions . \\nWe're cutting  off Russia's  largest  banks  from  the international financial  system;  preventing \\nRussia 's Central Bank  from  defending the Russian  ruble,  making Putin 's $630 billion  war fund \\nworthless. We're choking Russia 's access to technology  that will sap its economic  strength  and \\nweaken  its military  for years to come.  \\nTonight  I say to the Russian  oligarchs  and the corrupt  leaders who have bilked  billions  of \\ndollars  off this violent  regime:  No more . The United  States— [applause ]—I mean  it. The United  \\nStates  Department  of Justice is assembling  a dedicated  task force  to go after the crimes  of the \\nRussian  oligarch s. \\nWe're joining  with European allies to find and seize their yachts,  their luxury apartments,  \\ntheir private  jets. We're coming  for your ill-begotten gains.  And tonight  I'm announcing  that we \\nwill join our allies in\", \"closing  off American  air space to all Russian  flights, further isolating  Russia \\nand adding an additional squeeze on their economy .  \\nHe has no idea what 's coming.  The ruble  has already  lost 30 percent  of its value,  the Russian  \\nstock  marke t has lost 40 percent  of its value,  and trading remains suspended.  The Russian  \\neconomy  is reeling,  and Putin  alone  is the one to blame.  \\nTogether  with our allies, we're providing support  to the Ukrainians in their fight  for freedom:  \\nmilitary  assistance,  economic  assistance,  humanitarian  assistance. We're giving  more  than a \\nbillion  dollars  in direct  assistance to Ukraine. And we'll continue  to aid the Ukrainian  people  as \\nthey defend  their country  and help ease their suffering .  \\nBut let me be clear:  Our Forces are not engaged  and will not engage in the conflict with \\nRussian  forces  in Ukraine. Our Forces are not going to Europe  to fight  [in]* Ukraine but to defend  \\nour NATO allies in the event\", \"that Putin  decides to keep  moving west.  For that purpose,  we have  \\nmobilized  American  ground forces,  air squadrons , ship deployments  to protect  NATO countries,  \\nincluding  Poland,  Romania,  Latvia, Lithuania, and Estonia. And as I've made  crystal  clear,  the \\nUnited  States  and our allies will defend  every  inch of territory  that is NATO territory  with the full \\nforce  of our collective  power —every  single  inch.  \\nAnd we're clear  eyed . The Ukrainians are fighting  back  with pure courage . But the next few \\ndays,  weeks,  and months  will be hard on them.  Putin has unleashed  violence  and chaos. But while  \\nhe may make  gains  on the battlefield, he'll pay a continuing high price  over the long run. And a \\npound of Ukrainian  people —the  proud,  proud people —pound  for pound,  ready  to fight  with \\nevery  inch of energy they have . They 've known 30 years  of independence —have  repeatedly  \\nshown  that they will not tolerate  anyone  who tries to take\", \"their country  backwards.  \\nTo all Americans,  I'll be honest  with you, as I've always promised  I would be. A Russian  \\ndictator  invading a foreign  country  has costs around the world . And I'm taking  robust  action  to \\nmake  sure the pain of our sanctions  is targeted  at Russian  economy  and that we use every  tool at \\nour disposal  to protect  American  businesses and consumers.   \\nTonight  I can announce  the United  States  has worked  with 30 other  countries  to release 60 \\nmillion  barrels of oil from  reserves around the world . America will lead that effort,  releasing  30 \\nmillion  barrels of our own Strategic  Petroleum  Reserve. And we stand  ready  to do more  if \\nnecessary,  united  with our allies.  \\nThese steps will help blunt  gas prices here at home . But I know  news about  what 's \\nhappening  can seem  alarming  to all Americans. But I want  you to know:  We're going  to be okay . \\nWe're going to be okay.  \\n                                                 \\n*\", 'White House correction.', \"3 When  the history  of this era is written, Putin 's war on Ukraine will have  left Russia weaker  \\nand the rest of the world  stronger .  \\nWhile  it shouldn' t have  taken  something so terrible  for people  around the world  to see what 's \\nat stake,  now everyone sees it clearly.  We see the unity  among leaders of nations,  a more  unified  \\nEurope,  a more  unified  West.  We see unity  among the people  who are gathering in cities  in large \\ncrowds around the world,  even  in Russia,  to demonstrate their support  for the people  of Ukraine.   \\nIn the battle  between  democracy  and autocracies,  democracies are rising  to the moment , and \\nthe world  is clearly  choosing the side of peace and security.  This is the real test, and it's going  to \\ntake time. So let us continue  to draw inspiration  from  the iron will of the Ukrainian  people.  \\nTo our fellow  Ukrainian  Americans who forged  a deep  bond that connects  our two nations:  \\nWe stand  with you. We stand  with you.\", \"Putin  may circle Kiev with tanks,  but he'll never  gain the \\nhearts and souls  of the Uranian  [Ukrainian ]* people . He'll never  extinguish their love of freedom . \\nAnd he will never,  never  weaken  the resolve  of the free world .  \\nWe meet  tonight  in an America that has lived  through  2 of the hardest  years this Nation  has \\never faced . The pandemic  has been  punishing. And so many  families  are living  paycheck  to \\npaycheck,  struggling  to keep  up with the rising  cost of food,  gas, housing,  and so much  more.   \\nI understand,  like many  of you did. My dad had to leave his home  in Scranton,  Pennsylvania,  \\nto find work . So, like many  of you, I grew  up in a family  when  the price of food went  up, it was \\nfelt throughout  the family; it had an impact.  That's why one of the first things  I did as President  \\nwas fight  to pass the American  Rescue Plan, because people  were hurting . We needed  to act, and \\nwe did. \\nFew pieces of legislation  have  done  more\", 'at a critical  moment  in our history  to lift us out of \\na crisis. It fueled  our efforts  to vaccinate  the Nation  and combat  COVID– 19. It deliv ered \\nimmediate economic  relief  to tens of millions  of Americans. It helped  put food on the table . \\nRemember  those long lines  of cars waiting  for hours  just to get a box of food put in their trunk ? It \\ncut the cost of health  care insurance. And as my dad used to say, it gave  the people  \"just a little \\nbit of breathing room. \" \\nAnd unlike  the $2 trillion  tax cut passed  in the previous  administration  that benefit ed the top \\n1 percent  of Americans,  the American  Rescue Plan——  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  ——the  American  Rescue  Plan helped  working people  and left no one \\nbehind. And,  folks —and  it worked . It worked . It worked  and created  jobs, lots of jobs. In fact, our \\neconomy  created  over 6.5 million  new jobs just last year,  more  jobs in 1 year than ever before  in \\nthe history  of the', \"United  States of America. The economy  grew at a rate of 5.7 last year, the \\nstrongest  growth  rate in 40 years and the first step in bringing  fundamental  change  to our \\neconomy  that hasn't worked for working  people  in this Nation  for too long.  \\nFor the past 40 years,  we were told that tax breaks for those  at the top and benefits would \\ntrickle  down and everyone  would benefit.  But that trickle -down theory  led to a weaker  economic \\ngrowth,  lower  wages,  bigger  deficits,  and a widening gap between  the top and everyone else in \\nthe—in nearly  a century .   \\nLook,  Vice President  Harris and I ran for office —and  I realize we have  fundamental  \\ndisagreements on this—but  ran for office  with a new economic  vision  for America:  invest  in \\nAmerica;  educate Americans;  grow  the workforce;  build  the economy  from  the bottom  up and the \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"4 middle  out, not from  the top down. Because we know —because we know —when  the middle  \\nclass grows,  the poor go way up, and the wealthy  do very well. \\nAmerica used to have  the best roads,  bridges,  and airports  on Earth . And now our \\ninfrastructure  is ranked  13th in the world . We won't be able to compete for the jobs of the 21st \\ncentury  if we don't fix it. That's why it was so important  to pass the bipartisan  infrastructure law. \\nAnd I thank my Republican  friend s who joined  to invest  and rebuild  America, the single  biggest  \\ninvestment  in history .  \\nIt was a bipartisan  effort,  and I want  to thank the members  of both parties who worked  to \\nmake  it happen. We're done  talking  about  infrastructure  weeks. We're now talkin g about  an \\ninfrastructure  decade. And look,  it's going to transform  America  to put us on a path to win the \\neconomic  competition  of the 21st century  that we face with the rest of the world,  particularly  \\nChina.  I've told Xi\", \"Jinping:  It's never  been  a good bet to bet against  the American  people.  \\nWe'll create good jobs for millions  of Americans— modernizing roads,  airports,  ports,  \\nwaterways—a ll across America. And we'll do it to withstand  the devastating  effects of climate  \\ncrisis and promote  environmental  justice. We'll build  a national  network  of 500,000 electric \\nvehicle charging stations;  begin to replace the poisonous  lead pipes  so every  child,  every  \\nAmerican  has clean  water  to drink  at home  and at school .  \\nWe're going to provide  affordable  high-speed  internet  for every  American —rural,  suburban,  \\nurban,  and Tribal communities . Four  thousand projects have  already  been  announced . Many  of \\nyou have  announced them in your districts.  And tonight  I'm announcing that, this year,  we will \\nstart fixing  over 65,000 miles  of highway and 1,500  bridges  in disrepair . And,  folks,  when  we use \\ntaxpayers' dollars  to rebuild  America,  we're going to do it\", \"by buying American . Buy American  \\nproducts . Support  American  jobs.  \\nThe Federal  Government  spends  about  $600  billion  a year to keep  this country  safe and \\nsecure. There 's been  a law on the books  for almost  a century  to make  sure taxpayers ' dollars  \\nsupport  American  jobs and businesses. Every  administration —Democrat  and Republican —says \\nthey'll do it, but we're actually  doing it. We'll buy America n to make  sure everything  from  the \\ndeck  of an aircraft  carrier  to the steel on highway  guardrails  is made  in America from  beginning \\nto end. All of it. All of it.  \\nBut, folks,  to compete for the jobs of the future,  we also need  to level  the playing field with \\nChina  and other  competitors . That's why it's so important  to pass the bipartisan  innovation act \\nsitting  in Congress  that will make  record  investments in emerging  technologies  and American  \\nmanufacturing.  We used to invest  almost  2 percent  of our GDP  in research  and\", 'development . We \\ndon\\'t now. Can\\'t—China  is. \\nLet me give you one example  why it\\'s so important  to pass.  If you travel  20 miles  east of \\nColumbus,  Ohio,  you\\'ll find a thousand  empty  acres of land. It won\\'t look like much . But if you \\nstop and look closely,  you\\'ll see a \"field of dreams ,\" the ground on which  America \\'s future  will be \\nbuilt. That\\'s  where Intel, the American  company  that helped  build Silicon  Valley,  is going to \\nbuild  a $20 billion  semiconductor  \"mega  site,\" up to eight  state-of -the-art factories in one place. \\nTen thousand  new jobs. And in those  factories,  the average job—about  $135—$135,000  a year.  \\nSome  of the most  sophisticated  manufacturing in the world  to make  computer  chips  the size \\nof a fingertip  that power  the world  and everyday  lives,  from  smartphones,  technology  that—the  \\ninternet —technology  that\\'s  yet to be invented.  But that\\'s just the beginning.  \\nIntel\\'s CEO,  Pat Gelsinger,  who is here tonight —and  I', \"don't  know  where Pat is. Pat? There \\nyou go, Pat. Stand  up. Pat came  to see me, and he told me they're  ready  to increase their \\ninvestment  from  $20 billion  to $100  billion. That would  be the biggest  investment  in\", '5 manufacturing in American  history . And all they\\'re waiting  for is for you to pass this bill. So let\\'s \\nnot wait any longer . Send  it to my desk,  I\\'ll sign it, and we will really  take off in a big way.  \\nAnd,  folks,  Intel is not alone . There\\'s  something  happening  in America. Just look around,  \\nand you\\'ll see an amazing  story —the  rebirth  of pride  that comes from  stamping  products  \"Made  \\nin America, \" the revitalization  of American  manufacturing.  Companies  are choosing to build  new \\nfactories here when  just a few years ago, they would  have  gone  overseas. That\\'s what  is \\nhappening.  Ford  is investing $11 billion  in electric vehicles,  creating  11,000  jobs across the \\ncountry.  GM is making the largest  investment  in its history —$7  billion  to build electric vehicles,  \\ncreating  4,000 jobs in Michigan.  All told, 369,000 new manufacturing jobs were  created  in \\nAmerica last year alone .  \\nAnd, f olks,  powered  by people  I\\'ve met—like  JoJo', 'Burgess from  generations  of union  \\nsteelworkers in Pittsburgh, who\\'s here with us tonight . Where are you, JoJo? There  you go. \\nThanks,  buddy . As Ohio —as Ohio  Senator  Sherrod  Brown  says—[ applause ]—as Sherrod Brown  \\nsays,  \"It\\'s time to bury the label  \\'Rust  Belt.\\' \" It\\'s time to see the—what  used to be called  the Rust \\nBelt become the home  of a significant  resurgence of manufacturing.  \\nAnd with all the bright  spots  in our economy —record  job growth,  higher  wages —too  many  \\nfamilies  are struggling  to keep  up with their bills. Inflation  is robbing them  of gains  they thought  \\notherwise they would be able to feel. I get it. That\\'s why my top priority  is getting  prices unde r \\ncontrol.  \\nLook,  our economy  roared  back  faster  than almost  anyone  predicted,  but the pandemic  \\nmeant  that businesses had a hard time hiring  enough people  because  of the pandemic  to keep  up \\nproduction in their factories. So you didn\\'t  have  people  making those', \"1 Admi nistration of Joseph R. Biden, Jr., 2021 \\nAddress Before a Joint Session of the Congress \\nApril 28, 2021 \\nThe President.  Thank you.

[ Laughter ] Anyway, thank you all.  \\nMadam Speaker, Madam Vice President —no President has ever said those words from this \\npodium. No President has ever said those words, and it's about time.  \\nFirst Lady —I'm her husband; Second Gentleman; Chief Justice; Members of the United \\nStates Congress and the Cabinet; distinguished guests; my fellow Americans: While the setting \\ntonight is familiar, this gathering is just a little bit different, a reminder of the extraordinary times \\nwe're in.  \\nThroughout our history, Presidents have come to this Chamber to speak to Congress, to the \\nNation , and to the world;  to declare war, to celebrate peace;  to announce new plans and \\npossibilities. Tonight I come to talk about crisis and\", 'Volodomyr .', \"6 And here' s the plan.  First, cut the cost of prescription  drugs . We pay more  for the same  drug \\nproduced by the same  company  in America than any other  country  in the world.  Just look at \\ninsulin . One in ten Americans has diabetes. In Virginia,  I met a 13-year -old boy, the handsome  \\nyoung man standing up there,  Joshua  Davis. He and his dad both have  type 1 diabetes,  which \\nmeans they need  insulin  every  single  day. Insulin  costs about  $10 a vial to make . That's  what  it \\ncosts the pharmaceutical  company . But drug companies  charge families  like Joshua  and his dad \\nup to 30 times  that amount.  \\nI spoke  with Joshua 's mom . Imagine  what  it's like to look at your child  who needs  insulin  to \\nstay healthy  and have  no idea how in God's  name  you're going to be able to pay for it—what  it \\ndoes to your family, but what  it does to your dignity,  your ability  to look your child  in the eye, to \\nbe the parent  you expect  yourself  to be. I really  mean\", \"it. Think  about  that. That's  what  I think  \\nabout.  You know,  yesterday —Joshua  is here tonight,  but yesterday  was his birthday . Happy  \\nbirthday,  buddy, by the way.  \\nFor Joshua  and 200,000 other  young  people  with type 1 diabetes,  let's cap the cost of insulin  \\nat $35 a month so everyone  can afford  it. And drug companies will do very,  very well—their  \\nprofit  margin.  And while  we're at it—I know  we have  great disagreements on this floor  with \\nthis—let's  let Medicare negotiate  the price of prescription  drugs . They  already  set the price for \\nVA drugs.  Look,  the American  Rescue Plan is helping  millions  of families  on Affordable  Care  \\nAct plans  to save them  $2,400 a year on their health  premiums . Let's close the coverage gap and \\nmake  those  savings  permanent .  \\nAnd second,  let's cut energy costs for families  an average of $500 a year by combating  \\nclimate change.  Let's provide  an investment  and tax credit  to weatherize your home  and\", \"your \\nbusiness to be energy  efficient  and get a tax credit  for it; double America 's clean  energy  \\nproduction in solar,  wind,  and so much  more;  lower  the price of electric vehicles,  saving  another  \\n$80 a month that you've  not going to have  to pay at the pump.  \\nFolks —third —the  third  thing  we can do to change  the standard  of living for hard-working \\nfolks  is cut the cost of childcare. [Applause ] Cut the cost of childcare. Folks, if you live in a major  \\ncity in America,  you can pay up to $14,000 a year for child care per child. I was a single  dad for 5 \\nyears,  raising  two kids. I had a lot of help though. I had a mom,  a dad, a brother,  and sister  that \\nreally  helped.  But middle  class and working folks  shouldn' t have  to pay more  than 7 percent  of \\ntheir income  to care for their young children .  \\nMy plan would  cut the cost of childcare in half for most  families  and help parents,  including  \\nmillions  of women  who left the workforce  during the\", \"pandemic  because they couldn' t afford  \\nchildcare to be able to get back  to work,  generating  economic  growth.  But my plan doesn 't stop \\nthere. It also includes  home  and long-term  care,  more  affordable  housing,  pre-K for 3- and 4-\\nyear-olds . All of these will lower  costs to families.  \\nAnd under  my plan,  nobody —let  me say this again —nobody  earning less than $400,000 a \\nyear will pay an additional  penny  in new taxes. Not a single  penny.  I may be wrong,  but my guess  \\nis, if we took a secret  ballot in this floor,  that we'd all agree that the present  tax system  ain't fair. \\nWe have  to fix it. I'm not looking to punish  anybody,  but let's make  corporations  and wealthy  \\nAmericans start paying their fair share.  \\nLook,  last year—[applause ]—last  year—and like Chris  Coons  and Tom  Carper and my \\ndistinguished  Congresswoman —we  come  from  the land of corporate America . There are more  \\ncorporations  incorporated in America [Delaware ]* than every\", 'other  State in America combined . \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.', \"7 And I still won 36 years in a row. The point  is, even they understand  they should pay just a fair \\nshare.  \\nLast year,  55 of the Fortune  500 companies  earned  $40 billion  in profit  and paid zero in \\nFederal  taxes.  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  No, look,  it's not fair. That's why I proposed a 15-percent  minimum  tax rate \\nfor corporations . And w e've got—and  that's why in the G–7 and other  meetings overseas we were \\nable to put together —I was able to be somewhat  helpful —130  countries to agree on a global  \\nminimum  tax rate so companies can't get out of paying  their taxes at home  by shipping  jobs and \\nfactories overseas. It will raise billions  of dollars.  \\nAnd that's why I've proposed closing  loopholes  for the very wealthy  who don't pay—who  \\npay a lower  tax rate than a teacher  and a firefighter.  So that's my plan. But we have —we 'll go into \\nmore  detail  later.  I'm going  to grow —we will grow  the economy,  lower  the costs to families.\", \"So \\nwhat  are we waiting  for? Let's get this done . We all know  we've got to make  changes.  \\nFolks, and while  you're at it, confirm  my nominees  for the Federal  Reserve, which  plays  a \\ncritical  role in fighting inflation.  \\nMy plan will not only lower  costs and give families  a fair shot,  it will lower  the deficit. The \\nprevious  administration  not only ballooned  the deficit  with those tax cuts for the very wealthy  and \\ncorporations,  it undermined the watchdogs —the  job of those  to keep  pandemic  relief  funds  from  \\nbeing wasted . Remember  we had those  debates about  wheth er or not those  watchdogs  should be \\nable to see, every  day, how much  money  was being spent,  where it—was it going to the right  \\nplace?  \\nIn my administration, the watchdogs  are back . And we're going after the criminals who stole  \\nbillions  of relief  money  meant  for small  business and millions  of Americans.  And tonight  I'm \\nannouncing that the Justice Department  will soon\", \"name  a chief  prosecutor  for pandemic  fraud .  \\nAnd look—[applause ]—I think  we all agree—thank you—by  the end of this year,  the deficit  \\nwill be down  to less than half what  it was before  I took office , the only President  ever to cut the \\ndeficit  by more  than $1 trillion  in a single  year.  \\nLowering  your costs also meant  demanding more  competition . I'm a capitalist,  but capitalism  \\nwithout  competition  is not capitalism . Capitalism  without  competition  is exploitation. It drives  up \\nprofits  [prices ].* When  corporations  have  to compete,  their profits  go up and your prices go up—\\nwhen  they don't have  to compete.  Small  businesses and family  farmers  and ranchers—I need  not \\ntell some  of my Republican  friends  from  those  States—guess what ? You've got four basic \\nmeatpacking  facilities . That' s it. You play with them  or you don't get to play at all. And you pay a \\nhell of a lot more —a hell of a lot more —because there 's only four.  \\nSee\", \"what's happening  with ocean  carriers  moving goods  in and out of America. During the \\npandemic,  about  half a dozen  or less foreign -owned  companies  raised  prices by as much  as 1,000 \\npercent  and made  record  profits.  Tonight  I'm announcing a crackdown  on those  companies  \\novercharging American  businesses and consumers.  \\nFolks —[applause ]—and as Wall  Street  firms  take over more  nursing homes,  quality  in those  \\nhomes  has gone  down,  and costs  have  gone  up. That ends on my watch.  Medicare is going to set \\nhigher  standards for nursing homes  and make  sure your loved ones get the care they deserve and \\nthat they inspect and they will—looked  at closely.  We're also going to cut costs to keep  the \\neconomy  going strong  and giving  workers  a fair shot;  provide  more  training  and apprenticeships;  \\nhire them  based  on skills, not just their degrees.\", \"8 Let's pass the Paycheck  Fairness Act and paid leave;  raise the minimum  wage to $15 an \\nhour;  and extend  the child tax credit so no one has to raise a family  in poverty . Let's increase Pell \\ngrants;  increase our historic  support  for HBCUs;  and invest  in what  Jill, our First Lady,  who \\nteaches full time,  calls America 's best kept secret:  community  colleges.  \\nLook,  let's pass the PRO  Act. When  a majority  of worke rs want  to form  a union,  they \\nshouldn' t be able to be stopped . When  we invest  in our workers and we build  an economy  from  \\nthe bottom  up and the middle  out, together  we can do something  we haven 't done  in a long time: \\nbuild  a better  America.  \\nFor more  than 2 years,  COVID has impacted  every  decision  in our lives  and the life of this \\nNation . And I know  you're tired, frustrated,  and exhausted . That doesn 't even  count  the close to a \\nmillion  people  who sit at a dining  room  table  or a kitchen  table  and look at an empty\", 'chair  \\nbecause they lost somebody.   \\nBut I also know  this: Because of the progress we\\'ve made,  because of your resilience and the \\ntools  that we have  been  provided by this Congress,  tonight I can say we\\'re moving forward  safely,  \\nback  to a more —normal  routines.  We\\'ve reached  a new moment  in the fight  against  COVID– 19 \\nwhere severe cases are down to a level  not seen since July of last year.  \\nJust a few days ago, the Center  for Disease Control  and Prevention  issued  a new mask  \\nguidelines . Under  the new guidelines,  most  Americans in most  of the country  can now go mask  \\nfree. And based  on projecti ons, more  of the country  will reach  a point  across—that  point  across \\nthe next couple  of weeks.  And thanks  to the progress we\\'ve made  in the past year,  COVID– 19 no \\nlonger  need  control  our lives . I know  some  are talking  about  \"living  with COVID– 19.\" But \\ntonight I say that we never  will just accept  living  with COVID– 19; we\\'ll continue', \"to combat  the \\nvirus  as we do other  diseases.  \\nAnd because this virus  mutates and spreads,  we have  to stay on guard. And here are four \\ncommonsense steps as we move  forward  safely,  in my view:  first, stay protected  with vaccines \\nand treatments. We know  how incredibly effective vaccines are. If you're vaccinated  and boosted,  \\nyou have  the highest  degree of protection, and we'll  never  give up on vaccinating  more  \\nAmericans.  Now,  I know  parents with kids under  5 are eager  to see their vaccines authorized  for \\ntheir children . Scientists  are working hard to get that done,  and we'll be ready  with plenty  of \\nvaccines if and when  they do. \\nWe're already —we are also ready  with antiviral treatments.  If you get COVID– 19, the Pfizer  \\npill reduces your chances of ending up in the hospital  by 90 percent.  I've ordered  more  pills than \\nanyone  in the world  has. Pfizer  is working overtime  to get us a million  pills this month and more  \\nthan double  that\", 'next month.  And now we\\'re launching the \"Test  To Treat\"  initiative  so people  \\ncan get tested  at a pharmacy  and, if they prove  positive,  receive the antiviral pills on the spot at \\nno cost.  \\nAnd, f olks, if you\\'re immunocompromised or have  some  other  vulnerability, we have  \\ntreatments and free high-quality  masks.  We\\'re leaving  no one behind or ignoring  anyone \\'s needs  \\nas we move  forward.  On testing, we\\'ve made  hundreds  of millions  of tests available,  and you can \\norder  them  for free to your doorstep.  And we\\'ve already  ordered  free tests. If you already  ordered  \\nfree tests,  tonight  I\\'m announcing you can order  another  group  of tests. COVID —go to \\nCOVIDt ests.gov,  starting  next week,  and you can get more  tests.  \\nSecond,  we must  prepare for new variants.  Over  the past—we \\'ve gotten  much  better  at \\ndetecting  new variants. If necessary,  we\\'ll be able to develop  [deploy ]* new vaccines within  a \\nhundred days instead  of maybe  months  or', 'years. And if Congress presides [provides ]* the funds  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.', \"9 we need,  we'll have  new stockpiles of tests,  masks,  pills ready  if needed.  I can't promise  a new \\nvariant  won't come,  but I can promise  you we'll do everything  within  our power  to be ready  if it \\ndoes.  \\nThird, we can end the shutdown of schools and businesses. We have the tools  we need.  It's \\ntime for America  to get back  to work  and fill our great  downtowns  again  with people . People  \\nworking from  home  can feel safe and begin to return  to their offices.  \\nWe're doing that here in the Federal  Government . The vast majority  of Federal  workers will \\nonce  again  work  in person.  Our schools  are open. Let's keep  it that way. Our kids need  to be in \\nschool . With  75 percent  of adult  Americans fully  vaccinated  and hospitalizations  down by 77 \\npercent,  most  Americans can remove  their masks and stay in the classroom  and move  forward  \\nsafely.  \\nWe achieved  this because we provided free vaccines,  treatments,  tests,  and masks. Of \\ncourse,\", \"continuing  this costs  money,  so it will not surprise you I'll be back  to see you all. \\n[Laught er] And I'm going to soon send a request  to Congress.  The vast majority  of Americans  \\nhave  used these tools  and may want  again —we may need  them  again . So I expect  Congress —and  \\nI hope  you'll  pass that quickly.  \\nFourth,  we'll  continue  vaccinating  the world . We've sent 475 million  vaccine doses to 112 \\ncountries —more  than any nation  on Earth . We won't stop,  because you can't build a wall high \\nenough to keep  out a vaccine—the  vaccine can stop the spread  of these diseases.   \\nYou know,  we've  lost so much  in COVID– 19. Time  with one another . The worst  of all, the \\nloss of life. Let's use this moment  to reset . So stop looking at COVID as a partisan  dividing  line. \\nSee it for what  it is, a God-awful  disease.  Let's stop sending—seeing  each other  as enemies  and \\nstart seeing  each other  for who we are, fellow  Americans .  \\nLook, we can't change\", \"how divided we've been . That was a long time in coming . But we can \\nchange  how to move  forward  on COVID– 19 and other  issues that we must  face together.  \\nI recently  visited  New York  City Polic e Department  days after the funerals of Officer  \\nWilbert Mora  and his partner,  Officer  Jason  Rivera.  They  were responding to a 911 call when  a \\nman shot and killed  them  with a stolen  gun. Officer  Mora  was 27 years  old. Officer  Rivera  was \\n22 years old. Both  Dominican  Americans who grew up in the same streets that they later chose to \\nparol e—to patrol  as police  officers.  I spoke  with their families, and I told them  that we are \\nforever in debt for their sacrifices and we'll  carry  on their mission  to restore the trust and safety  in \\nevery  community  it deserves.  \\nLike some  of you that have  been  around for a while —I've  worked  with you on these issues \\nfor a long time. I know  what  works:  Investigating  [Investing in]* crime  prevention and\", \"community  policing : cops who walk  the beat,  who know  the neighborhood,  and who can restore \\ntrust and safety.   \\nLet's  not abandon our streets or choose  between  safety  and equal  justice . Let's come  together  \\nand protect  our communities,  restore trust, and hold law enforcement  accountable.  That's why the \\nJustice Department  has required  body  cameras,  banned chokeholds,  and restricted  no-knock \\nwarrants for its officers.  \\nThat's why the American  Rescue Plan that you all provided $350 billion  that cities, States,  \\nand counties  can use to hire more  police, invest  in more  proven strategies like community  \\nviolence  interruption, trusted  messengers breaking the cycle of violence and trauma  and giving \\nyoung people  some  hope.  We should all agree the answer  is not to defund the police.  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"10 Audience member.  That's  right!  \\nThe President.  It's to fund the police . Fund  them . Fund them . Fund them  with the resources \\nand training —resources and training  they need  to protect  our communities.  I ask Democrats and \\nRepublicans  alike  to pass my budget  and keep  our neighborhoods  safe. And we'll  do everything \\nin my power  to crack  down on gun trafficking  of ghost  guns  that you can buy online,  assemble  at \\nhome —no serial  numbers,  can't be traced.  I ask Congress to pass proven measures to reduce gun \\nviolence . Pass universal  background checks. Why should anyone  on the terrorist  list be able to \\npurchase a weapon . Why ? Why ?  \\nAudience members.  Boo! \\nThe President.  And,  folks,  ban assault  weapons  with high-capacity  magazines that hold up to \\na hundred rounds . You think  the deer are wearing  Kevlar  vests? [Laughter ] Look,  repeal  the \\nliability  shield  that makes  gun manufacturers the only industry  in America  that can't be sued—the\", \"only one. Imagine  had we done  that with the tobacco  manufactur ers. These laws don't infringe  on \\nthe Second  Amendment , they save lives.  \\nThe most  fundamental  right  in America is the right  to vote and have  it counted. And look,  \\nit's under  assault.  In State after State, new laws have  been  passed  not only to suppress the vote—\\nwe've  been  there before —but  to subvert  the entire  election . We can't let this happen.  Tonight  I \\ncall on the Senate to pass the Freedom  To Vote act. Pass the John Lewis Act—Voting  Rights  Act. \\nAnd while  you're at it, pass the DISCLOSE Act so Americans know  who is funding our elections.  \\nLook,  tonight  I'd like to honor  someone  who has dedicated  his life to serve this country:  \\nJustice Breyer, an Army  veteran,  constitutional scholar,  retiring  Justice of the United  States  \\nSupreme  Court.  Justice Breyer,  thank you for your service. Thank you, thank  you, thank you. I \\nmean  it. Get up. Stand  and let them  see you.\", \"Thank you.  \\nAnd we all know —no matter  what  your ideology,  we all know  one of the most  serious  \\nconstitutional  responsibilities  a President  has is nominating  someone to serve on the United  States \\nSupreme  Court.  As I did 4 days ago, I've nominated a Circuit  Court  of Appeals— Ketanji  Brown  \\nJackson .  \\nOne of our Nation 's top legal  minds  who will continue  in Justice Breyer 's legacy  of \\nexcellence. A former top litigator  in private  practice,  a former Federal  public  defender  from  a \\nfamily  of public -school  educators and police  officers , she's a consensus  builder.  Since she's been  \\nnominated,  she's received  a broad range  of support,  including  the Fraternal  Order  of Police  and \\nformer judges  appointed by Democrats and Republicans.  \\nFolks, if we are to advance liberty  and justice,  we need  to secure our border  and fix the \\nimmigration  system .  \\nAudience members.  Build  the wall! Build  the wall! Build  the wall!  \\nThe President.  And as\", \"you might  guess,  I think  we can do both. At our border,  we've \\ninstalled  new technology,  like cutting -edge  scanners,  to better  detect  drug smuggling.  We've set \\nup joint patrols  with Mexico  and Guatemala to catch  more  human traffickers.  We're putting  in \\nplace dedicated  immigration  judges  in significant larger  number  so families  fleeing  persecution  \\nand violence  can have  their cases—cases heard  faster —and  those  who don't  [aren't ]* legitimately  \\nhere can be sent back.  \\nWe're screening —we' re securing  commitments  and supporting partners in South  and Central  \\nAmerica to host more  refugees and secure their own borders.  We can do all this while  keeping lit \\nthe torch  of liberty  that has led the generation  of immigrants  to this land, my forebearers and \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", '11 many  of yours.  Provide  a pathway  to citizenship  for \"dreamers,\" those  with temporary  status,  \\nfarmworkers,  essential  workers. To revise our laws so businesses have  workers they need  and \\nfamilies  don\\'t wait decades  to reunite.   \\nIt\\'s not only the right  thing  to do, it\\'s economically  smart  thing  to do. That\\'s why the \\nimmigration  reform  is supported by everyone  from  labor  unions  to religious  leaders to the U.S. \\nChamber  of Commerce . Let\\'s get it done  once  and for all.  \\nFolks, advancing liberty  and justice  also requires protecting  the rights  of women . The \\nconstitutional  right  affirmed  by Roe v. Wade , standing precedent  for half a century,  is under  \\nattack  as never  before.  If you want  to go forward  not backwards,  we must  protect  access to health  \\ncare,  preserve  a woman \\'s right  to choose,  and continue  to advance maternal  health  care for all \\nAmericans.  \\nAnd, folks,  for our LGBTQ+ Americans,  let\\'s finally  get the', \"bipartisan  Equality  Act to my \\ndesk. The onslaught  of State laws targeting  transgender  Americans and their families —it's simply  \\nwrong.  As I said last year,  especially  to our younger  transgender  Americans,  I'll always have  your \\nback  as your President  so you can be yourself  and reach  your God-given potential .  \\nFolks , as I've just demonstrated,  while  it often  appears we do not agree— [laughter ]—and  \\nthat—we do agree on a lot more  things  than we acknowledge.  I signed  80 bipartisan  bills into law \\nlast year,  from  preventing Government  shutdowns,  to protecting  Asian  Americans  from  still-too-\\ncommon  hate crimes,  to reforming  military  justice . And we'll soon be strengthening the Violence \\nAgainst  Women  Act that I first wrote three decades ago.  \\nAnd it's important —it's  important —for us to show  the Nation  that we can come  together  and \\ndo big things.  So tonight  I'm offering  a unity agenda  for the Nation:  four big things  we can do\", \"together,  in my view.  \\nFirst, beat the opioid epidemic . There 's so much  we can do: increase  funding for prevention,  \\ntreatment,  harm  reduction,  and recovery;  get rid of outdated rules and stop doctors  and—that  stop \\ndoctors  from  prescribing  treatments;  stop the flow of illicit drugs  by working  with State and local  \\nlaw enforcement  to go after the traffickers . And if you're suffering  from  addiction,  you know —\\nyou should know  you're not alone . I believe in recovery,  and I celebrate the 23 million —23 \\nmillion  Americans in recovery .  \\nSecon d, let's take on mental  health —especially  among  our children,  whose lives  and \\neducation  have  been  turned  upside  down.  The American  Rescue Plan gave  schools  money  to hire \\nteacher s and help students  make  up for lost learning . I urge every  parent  to make  sure your school  \\ndoes just that. They  have  the money.  We can all play a part. Sign up to be a tutor  or a mentor . \\nChildren  were also\", \"struggling before  the pandemic:  bullying, violenc e, trauma,  and the harms  of \\nsocial  media.  \\nAs Frances Haugen,  who is here tonight  with us, has shown,  we must  hold social  media  \\nplatforms  accountable  for the national  experiment  they're conducting on our children  for profit . \\nFolks—[applause ]—thank  you. Thank you for the courage you showed.  It's time to strengthen  \\nprivacy  protections;  ban targeted  advertising  to children;  demand  tech companies stop collecting  \\npersonal  data on our children.  And let's get all Americans the mental  health  services they need . \\nMore people  can turn for help and full parity  between  physical  and mental  health  care if we treat \\nit that way in our insurance.  \\nLook,  the third  piece of that agenda  is support  our veterans. Veterans are the backbone  and \\nthe spine  of this country . They 're the best of us. I've always believed  that we have  a sacred  \\nobligation  to equip those  we send to war and care for those\", 'and their family  when  they come', \"12 home.  My administration  is providing assistance and job training  and housing and now helping \\nlower  income  veterans get VA care debt free. \\nAnd our troops  in Iraq have  faced —and Afghanistan —have  faced  many dangers. One being \\nstationed  at bases,  breathing in toxic  smoke  from  burn pits. Many  of you have  been  there. I've \\nbeen  in and out of Iraq and Afghanistan  over 40 times . These burn pits that incinerate waste —the \\nwastes of war, medical  and hazardous  materi al, jet fuel, and so much  more.  And they come  \\nhome —many  of the world 's fittest and best trained  warriors  in the world —never  the same:  \\nheadaches,  numbness,  dizziness,  a cancer  that would put them  in a flag-draped  coffin . I know.  \\nRepresentative Lauren Boebert . You put them  in. Thirteen  of them.  \\nAudience members.  Whoa!  \\nAudience members. Boo ! \\nThe President.  One of those —one  of those  soldiers was my son, Major  Beau  Biden . I don't \\nknow  for sure if the burn pit that he\", \"lived  near—that  his hooch was near in Iraq and, earlier  than \\nthat, in Kosovo  is the cause of his brain  cancer  and the disease of so many  other  troops . But I'm \\ncommitted  to find out everythi ng we can. \\nCommitted  to military  families like Danielle Robinson  from  Ohio,  the widow  of Sergeant  \\nFirst Class Heath  Robinson. He was born a soldier . Army  National  Guar d. Combat  medic  in \\nKosovo and Iraq. Stationed  near Baghdad,  just yards from  burn pits the size of football  fields.   \\nDanielle is here with us tonight . They  loved  going to Ohio  State  football  games . And he \\nloved building  Legos  with their daughter . But cancer  from  prolonged exposure  to burn pits \\nravaged  Heath 's lungs  and body.  Danielle says Heath  was a fighter  to the very end. He didn' t \\nknow  how to stop fighting,  and neither  did she. Through  her pain,  she found  purpose  to demand \\nthat we do better . Tonight, Danielle,  we are going to do better .  \\nThe VA is pioneering new\", \"ways of linking  toxic  exposures to disease,  already  helping more  \\nveterans get benefits. And tonight  I'm announcin g we're expanding eligibility  to veterans \\nsuffering  from  nine respiratory  cancers.  I'm also calling  on Congress  to pass a law to make  sure \\nveterans devastated  by toxic  exposure  in Iraq and Afghanistan  finally  get the benefits and the \\ncomprehensive health  care they deserve.  \\nAnd fourth  and last, let's end cancer  as we know  it. This is personal . This is personal  to me \\nand to Jill and to Kamala and so many  of you. So many  of you have  lost someone you love—\\nhusband,  wife,  son, daughter,  mom,  dad. Cancer  is the number -two cause of death  in America,  \\nsecond  only to heart  disease.   \\nLast month,  I announced the plan to supercharge the Cancer  Moonshot  that President  Obama \\nasked  me to lead 6 years ago. Our goal is to cut cancer  death  rates by at least 50 percent  over the \\nnext 25 years. And I think we can do bette r than that:\", \"turn cancers from  death  sentences into \\ntreatable diseases,  more  support  for patients and their families.  \\nTo get there,  I call on Congress to fund what  I called  ARPA– H: Advanced  Research  Projects  \\nAgency  for Health . Patterned  after DARPA  in the Defense Department,  projects that led—in \\nDARPA —to the internet,  GPS, and so much  more  that make  our Forces more —safer  and be able \\nto wage war more —with  more  clarity. ARPA [ARPA –H]* will have  a singular  purpose  to drive  \\nbreakthroughs  in cancer,  Alzheimer 's, and diabetes,  and more.  A unity agenda  for the Nation . We \\ncan do these things . It's within  our power . And I don't  see a partisan  edge  to any one of those  four \\nthings.  \\n                                                 \\n* White House correction.\", \"13 My fellow  Americans,  tonight  we've gathered  in a sacred  space:  the citadel  of democracy . In \\nthis Capitol, generation  after generation  of Americans  have  debated  great  questions  amid  great  \\nstrife  and have  done  great  things.  We fought  for freedom,  expanded liberty, debated  [defeated ]* \\ntotalitarianism  and terror. We built the strongest,  freest,  and most  prosperous  nation  the world  has \\never known.   \\nNow is the hour:  our moment  of responsibility, our test of resolve and conscience of history  \\nitself .

EngageMate© is an HCP/HCO engagements tool developed by Cresen Solutions that enables our clients to fully track HCP and\", 'HCO  engagements throughout the entire life cycle. The system is designed to automate the business lifecycle of any fee for service engagement from business planning through close-out. It will also serve as the auditable system of record for all associated HCP/HCO fee-based contractual arrangements.  There are many problems to be solved in the engagement lifecycle, EngageMate shines in the way it solves these problems.

Engaging a service provider is often a lengthy process with many moving pieces and interactions between departments. During that time, the Compliance department is attempting to keep track of, and approve, all activities and service providers to ensure compliance with external government regulations and internal company policies. The HCP engagement process involves workflow including fair market value (FMV) assessments and exceptions, activity concept reviews, nomination review and approvals, content review/approvals, monetary spend capture, and appropriate certification and activity close-out. As an added layer of complexity, the events can be held around the globe with service providers from many countries, all of whom need their own respective', \"cross-border workflows. While it is possible to track the engagement process via spreadsheets, word documents, and emails, this can be messy and error prone. In today's age of big data and required government reporting, the difficult task of manually tracking engagements is quickly becoming impossible. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have an easy-to-use system where a company can track and manage activities, approvals, and FMV tiers and rates all in one place.  EngageMate© is an elegant system that solves all the problems associated with the engagement lifecycle.  Recently, after an unsatisfactory experience with another engagement tool, a top pharmaceutical company returned to tracking their activities with emails, spreadsheets, and word documents. Cresen Solutions was then brought in to implement EngageMate©. After gathering business requirements around workflow requirements, business rules, and input forms EngageMate© was configured to meet all of the client’s policies and\", 'SOPs. EngageMate© was integrated with their customer', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nmaster to pull service provider information into the system, ensuring accurate Customer(HCP or HCO) details while limiting manual data entry. Review workflows were created for each region within the company enabling a smooth process for the activity to be reviewed by multiple departments and reviewers across the globe. After the workflows are completed EngageMate© assures proper closure and certification processes aligned with company policy. EngageMate© uses all the latest technologies and uses common open integration methodologies to enable easy interfacing with other company business systems.  From adding service providers to filling out forms and submitting activities, business users have enjoyed EngageMate’s© responsiveness and ease of use. Most users were able to pick up the navigation and use of the system after one self-guided training session. Everyone, both “Submitters” and “Reviewers”, receive', \"email notifications when an activity is ready for their action. The email provides an embedded hyperlink that takes users directly to the activity they need to take action on. Additionally, upon logging into EngageMate©, users are presented with a simple landing page showing tiles that separate activities into distinct categories allowing users to see a filtered list of activities to find any activity they are looking for expeditiously. It also includes customizable dashboards that pull information from the system in real-time to provide metrics for activities, service providers used, approvals, and close-out alerts.  Given the ever-changing nature of the life sciences industry and government reporting, flexibility is a top priority for all Cresen Solutions’ product offerings, including EngageMate©. It is easy to create and edit any of the system's forms and needs assessment qualifications from the user interface, including quickly changing language translations. In the most recent\", \"implementation of EngageMate©, the system is translated into Japanese, with the help of translation vendors and the users themselves. Cresen Solutions can accommodate changes or updates to the translations rapidly without downtime. Where EngageMate© shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented in the system without hardcoding and interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time.    Finally, any system must have flexibility in how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable.  This problem is compounded as the user pool grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. EngageMate© allows user profiles to be easily\", \"managed by an administrator to add and remove users, change their assigned department, grant access to specific forms, and change their role in the system. Reviewers, or the administrator on the Reviewer's behalf, can delegate their role to another Reviewer while out on leave.  This allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while they are out of the office.   In conclusion, EngageMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the engagement lifecycle. It allows for the management of the entire engagement process globally.

Our organization has a clear focus and mission to enable improved business outcomes through advanced technology solutions and analytical expertise. The leadership team is comprised of seasoned healthcare industry experts focused on enabling the technological advancements necessary in today's ever-changing healthcare landscape. Strong foundations in technology systems and solutions and the business acumen to enable predictable business results are keys to our success. Experience, quality, and innovation are the cornerstones of our team's capabilities and are applied to each engagement.  Cresen Solutions developed MonitorMate© to enable our clients to easily assess global\", 'risk, create a calibrated monitoring plan, and track the execution of compliance monitoring and associated remedial events. The system is designed to automate the monitoring process of any company’s unique business need – from the risk assessment to the corrective action tracking for issues identified throughout the monitoring process. Additionally, the system has an automated workflow and email notification capability that eases the monitoring and remediation process of the company.    \\n Figure 1: Risk Monitoring Lifecycle.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nRisk management, auditing, and monitoring processes allow Life Science companies to conform with state and federal regulations while enabling them to also align with relevant internal policies and procedures. Within most companies, the global compliance department identifies potential risks through the execution of their ongoing monitoring process. Assessing the risk enables the organizations to identify weaknesses within the internal controls and identify policies and procedures that should be corrected. Companies can then take necessary corrective actions which ultimately can reduce the number of high-risk issues in the future. Additionally, the compliance department must monitor and document business events and interactions. Most companies lack flexibility and sophistication in identifying and mitigating their risk areas, monitoring, and auditing phases. The majority of these details are often tracked', 'through Excel sheets, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error. This manual tracking process becomes even more complex when the compliance teams are located across the globe in regions with varying international laws. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a refined system where companies can conduct a risk assessment, track monitoring, and remediation details, and easily assess the corrective measures. MonitorMate© is a refined system that seamlessly resolves many of the challenges associated within the risk monitoring lifecycle. Cresen Solutions prides itself on the satisfaction of our clients and the resulting associated improvements in business practices gained by switching from an outdated Excel-based approach to MonitorMate©. The system uses a simple question-based approach to evaluate global risk. The calculated risk value is then split into different ranges with corresponding colors which allows users to easily identify the activities with increased risk.', \"MonitorMate© supports single sign-on (SSO) and can also be integrated with different company source systems like an HR employee feed or a field-based sales roster Where MonitorMate© really shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented within the system without hardcoding and business interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a default value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time. MonitorMate© provides users with a comprehensive set of dashboards – accessible to all levels of the organization – to facilitate the real-time monitoring remediation and escalation of data captured within the system. For example, dynamic visuals such as heat maps are created with real-time data that helps the users to visualize\", '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ncolor-coded risk ratings to quickly identify risk severity. Dashboards, and sensitive or targeted information, can be aligned to different user roles created within the system, based on specific client requirements.  In many companies, compliance organizations can have large geographically dispersed structures with different roles and regions – within MonitorMate© we can customize the logic and associated dashboards to allow users restricted access to specific and relevant data for their regional and/or role assignments. Finally, any system must have the flexibility to support how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable. This problem is compounded as the user base grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. MonitorMate© allows user profiles to be easily managed by an administrator role.  Administrators can add', 'and remove users, limit the user to a specified region, change their assigned region, and change their role in the system. For example, a “monitor” role can assign an activity to multiple reviewers, which allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while a reviewer is out of the office. One of our recent clients had a specific business need that no other monitoring platform could effectively support. We developed a solution that catered to our client’s needs and allowed them to better capture their rep-ride monitoring data. This not only highlights MonitorMate’s© flexibility to accommodate specific business needs, but it ultimately resulted in a more sophisticated approach for capturing, analyzing, and identifying gaps in the field-based compliance monitoring process. In conclusion, MonitorMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the Risk Monitoring lifecycle. It is uniquely designed', 'to comprehensively assess, monitor, and evaluate global risk within a company.

Our organization has a clear focus and mission to enable improved business outcomes through advanced technology solutions and analytical expertise. The leadership team is comprised of seasoned healthcare industry experts focused on enabling the technological advancements necessary in today's ever-changing healthcare landscape.

Experience, quality, and innovation are the cornerstones of our team's capabilities and are applied to each engagement. SpendMate© is a healthcare compliance transparency tool designed to streamline the end-to-end business process of transparency reporting.\", 'Like other offerings in the Cresen Solutions suite, SpendMate© was created in partnership with our life sciences and pharmaceutical customers. SpendMate© enables companies to meet the growing demand for transparency between industry and medical providers in the form of report preparation, generation, and submission, doing so cost-effectively, and it also easily scales with companies as they expand globally. Transparency reporting has complex requirements, SpendMate© excels in the way it enables healthcare companies to efficiently navigate these requirements. All healthcare companies engage with medical professionals and organizations for various events and other engagements. Transactions from these interactions can include a service fee for speaking at an event, reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, and more. By law, or code, these transactions must be reported in each country where applicable and be made publicly available. Since the governing body can change based on', 'the country or region, the reporting requirements also differ. Another layer of complexity includes intricate business rules that are used to evaluate which transactions are reportable or not. While these reports can be created manually, doing so can prove error prone and time-consuming for compliance teams. When dealing with large numbers of transactions, manually determining which are to be reported is both inefficient and is generally considered poor business practice.  SpendMate© simplifies the spend reporting process by providing the flexibility and scalability needed by our clients to meet the compliance demands of external entities. Recently, SpendMate’s© reporting module was successfully implemented at a top 10 pharmaceutical company, providing greater control and configurability over their previous reporting solution. SpendMate© provides efficiency in form and function by having a user-friendly interface that is driven by a configurable business logic engine. This provides the', 'ability to add or remove attributes and business rules at any time without impacting legacy data. The key versatility of SpendMate© lies within its fully customizable forms and templates, allowing Cresen Solutions to', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ntailor the data entry forms and reporting templates to align with the needs of each client. Using SpendMate’s© end-to-end process, data can be imported from various engagement management systems, processed, validated, and reported using the built-in reporting module.  When operating on a global scale across different countries, users and user permissions must be managed effectively. User roles within SpendMate© are broken into 3 categories, Administrative, Data Coordinator, and Data Entry. Administrative accounts have access to all data and functionalities within SpendMate© and also have the ability to perform system administration and configuration. Data-Coordinators can create and edit transactions and submit them for verification as well as generate country-specific spend reports. To add a layer of data security, Data Coordinators can be assigned to specific countries and will only have access to the', 'assigned country’s data and reports. Lastly, the Data Entry role can be assigned to vendors giving them access to specific forms to enter transactions for commercial and research engagements. Users and their roles can be quickly set up or adjusted by the admins, ensuring a quick transition during times of employee turnover. Below in Figure 1 is an architecture diagram that showcases the different aspects of SpendMate©. \\n Figure 1: SpendMate© Architecture Diagram One key area in which SpendMate© excels is through its various activity management system integrations, allowing SpendMate© to receive a constant flow of data in relation to new events and other engagements between healthcare companies and medical professionals and organizations. The data received from these activity management systems is then cleaned and transformed before being displayed. To streamline the user’s access to SpendMate©, single sign-on integrations are supported but not required. Users can review and validate', 'the data within SpendMate© and use its built-in reporting module to generate spend reports specific to each country.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nTo ensure the accuracy of medical professional and organization customer records, SpendMate© has a partnership with Veeva Open Data and can integrate with other third-party vendors that maintain customer reference data to match the unique customer profiles. SpendMate© can be configured to send a request to a client’s customer master using an API call, and the returned match responses will be displayed for the user to select the matching customer profile. Additionally, SpendMate© supports automatic matching of the customer profiles if certain unique identifiers are present, such as the NPI number or other local identifiers. If duplicate customer profiles exist, SpendMate© has the added functionality of merging and unmerging customers to address these issues. One of the key features of SpendMate© is its reporting module, which supports the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations', '(EFPIA) reports, European Local Law reports, and U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports, Patient Organization (PO) reports, and other country specific reports (Brazil, Colombia, etc.). Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways. For that reason, SpendMate© allows our clients to determine which interactions are reportable and not reportable through business rules using mappings at the country and report type level. The same approach is applied to professional types, for example, a nurse might be reportable in Norway, but not in Switzerland, this can be easily handled through the mapping configurations of each country. For the purposes of validation, a validation file is automatically generated along with each report, following the same input parameters selected on the UI. Within the validation file are two key columns; if the transaction is included on the report and if not, the reason why it is excluded. The validation file can be used to quickly determine why certain transactions are missing from the disclosure report based on the reasoning provided. Users can also quickly adjust the mapping configurations to rectify the issue, if needed.', 'SpendMate’s© reporting module can also generate reports in different currencies and various numeric formats. SpendMate© offers users the choice of prepending or appending a currency code to the amount as per their requirements. The size of compliance teams can vary, therefore, SpendMate© allows for the saving of generated reports within the application. Saved reports can be accessed by everyone on the compliance team thereby reducing the need to constantly regenerate new reports. Reports from prior years can be maintained within the tool and are available for any updates or if a refreshed report is needed. Lastly, SpendMate© has an extensive audit trail capability that includes archiving/audit information on who generated which report, when it was generated, what the', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ninput parameters were, et cetera, allowing the compliance team to keep track of historical information and effectively respond to audit and exception inquires. In conclusion, SpendMate© is designed to simplify compliance transparency reporting on a global scale by supporting healthcare companies through every step of the process. SpendMate’s© ability to adapt paired with its flexibility allows our clients to thrive in the ever-changing landscape of compliance reporting.

Cresen Solutions developed MonitorMate© to enable our clients to easily assess global\", 'risk, create a calibrated monitoring plan, and track the execution of compliance monitoring and associated remedial events. The system is designed to automate the monitoring process of any company’s unique business need – from the risk assessment to the corrective action tracking for issues identified throughout the monitoring process.

Within most companies, the global compliance department identifies potential risks through the execution of their ongoing monitoring process. Assessing the risk enables the organizations to identify weaknesses within the internal controls and identify policies and procedures that should be corrected. Companies can then take necessary corrective actions which ultimately can reduce the number of high-risk issues in the future. Additionally, the compliance department must monitor and document business events and interactions. Most companies lack flexibility and sophistication in identifying and mitigating their risk areas, monitoring, and auditing phases. The majority of these details are often tracked', 'through Excel sheets, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error. This manual tracking process becomes even more complex when the compliance teams are located across the globe in regions with varying international laws. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a refined system where companies can conduct a risk assessment, track monitoring, and remediation details, and easily assess the corrective measures. MonitorMate© is a refined system that seamlessly resolves many of the challenges associated within the risk monitoring lifecycle. Cresen Solutions prides itself on the satisfaction of our clients and the resulting associated improvements in business practices gained by switching from an outdated Excel-based approach to MonitorMate©. The system uses a simple question-based approach to evaluate global risk. The calculated risk value is then split into different ranges with corresponding colors which allows users to easily identify the activities with increased risk.', \"MonitorMate© supports single sign-on (SSO) and can also be integrated with different company source systems like an HR employee feed or a field-based sales roster Where MonitorMate© really shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented within the system without hardcoding and business interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a default value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time.

Dashboards, and sensitive or targeted information, can be aligned to different user roles created within the system, based on specific client requirements.  In many companies, compliance organizations can have large geographically dispersed structures with different roles and regions – within MonitorMate© we can customize the logic and associated dashboards to allow users restricted access to specific and relevant data for their regional and/or role assignments. Finally, any system must have the flexibility to support how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable. This problem is compounded as the user base grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. MonitorMate© allows user profiles to be easily managed by an administrator role.  Administrators can add', 'and remove users, limit the user to a specified region, change their assigned region, and change their role in the system. For example, a “monitor” role can assign an activity to multiple reviewers, which allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while a reviewer is out of the office. One of our recent clients had a specific business need that no other monitoring platform could effectively support. We developed a solution that catered to our client’s needs and allowed them to better capture their rep-ride monitoring data. This not only highlights MonitorMate’s© flexibility to accommodate specific business needs, but it ultimately resulted in a more sophisticated approach for capturing, analyzing, and identifying gaps in the field-based compliance monitoring process.

SpendMate© is a healthcare compliance transparency tool designed to streamline the end-to-end business process of transparency reporting.\", 'Like other offerings in the Cresen Solutions suite, SpendMate© was created in partnership with our life sciences and pharmaceutical customers. SpendMate© enables companies to meet the growing demand for transparency between industry and medical providers in the form of report preparation, generation, and submission, doing so cost-effectively, and it also easily scales with companies as they expand globally. Transparency reporting has complex requirements, SpendMate© excels in the way it enables healthcare companies to efficiently navigate these requirements. All healthcare companies engage with medical professionals and organizations for various events and other engagements. Transactions from these interactions can include a service fee for speaking at an event, reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, and more. By law, or code, these transactions must be reported in each country where applicable and be made publicly available. Since the governing body can change based on', 'the country or region, the reporting requirements also differ. Another layer of complexity includes intricate business rules that are used to evaluate which transactions are reportable or not. While these reports can be created manually, doing so can prove error prone and time-consuming for compliance teams. When dealing with large numbers of transactions, manually determining which are to be reported is both inefficient and is generally considered poor business practice.  SpendMate© simplifies the spend reporting process by providing the flexibility and scalability needed by our clients to meet the compliance demands of external entities. Recently, SpendMate’s© reporting module was successfully implemented at a top 10 pharmaceutical company, providing greater control and configurability over their previous reporting solution. SpendMate© provides efficiency in form and function by having a user-friendly interface that is driven by a configurable business logic engine. This provides the', 'ability to add or remove attributes and business rules at any time without impacting legacy data. The key versatility of SpendMate© lies within its fully customizable forms and templates, allowing Cresen Solutions to', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ntailor the data entry forms and reporting templates to align with the needs of each client. Using SpendMate’s© end-to-end process, data can be imported from various engagement management systems, processed, validated, and reported using the built-in reporting module.  When operating on a global scale across different countries, users and user permissions must be managed effectively. User roles within SpendMate© are broken into 3 categories, Administrative, Data Coordinator, and Data Entry. Administrative accounts have access to all data and functionalities within SpendMate© and also have the ability to perform system administration and configuration. Data-Coordinators can create and edit transactions and submit them for verification as well as generate country-specific spend reports. To add a layer of data security, Data Coordinators can be assigned to specific countries and will only have access to the', 'assigned country’s data and reports. Lastly, the Data Entry role can be assigned to vendors giving them access to specific forms to enter transactions for commercial and research engagements. Users and their roles can be quickly set up or adjusted by the admins, ensuring a quick transition during times of employee turnover. Below in Figure 1 is an architecture diagram that showcases the different aspects of SpendMate©. \\n Figure 1: SpendMate© Architecture Diagram One key area in which SpendMate© excels is through its various activity management system integrations, allowing SpendMate© to receive a constant flow of data in relation to new events and other engagements between healthcare companies and medical professionals and organizations. The data received from these activity management systems is then cleaned and transformed before being displayed. To streamline the user’s access to SpendMate©, single sign-on integrations are supported but not required. Users can review and validate', 'the data within SpendMate© and use its built-in reporting module to generate spend reports specific to each country.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nTo ensure the accuracy of medical professional and organization customer records, SpendMate© has a partnership with Veeva Open Data and can integrate with other third-party vendors that maintain customer reference data to match the unique customer profiles. SpendMate© can be configured to send a request to a client’s customer master using an API call, and the returned match responses will be displayed for the user to select the matching customer profile. Additionally, SpendMate© supports automatic matching of the customer profiles if certain unique identifiers are present, such as the NPI number or other local identifiers. If duplicate customer profiles exist, SpendMate© has the added functionality of merging and unmerging customers to address these issues. One of the key features of SpendMate© is its reporting module, which supports the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations', '(EFPIA) reports, European Local Law reports, and U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports, Patient Organization (PO) reports, and other country specific reports (Brazil, Colombia, etc.). Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways. For that reason, SpendMate© allows our clients to determine which interactions are reportable and not reportable through business rules using mappings at the country and report type level. The same approach is applied to professional types, for example, a nurse might be reportable in Norway, but not in Switzerland, this can be easily handled through the mapping configurations of each country. For the purposes of validation, a validation file is automatically generated along with each report, following the same input parameters selected on the UI. Within the validation file are two key columns; if the transaction is included on the report and if not, the reason why it is excluded. The validation file can be used to quickly determine why certain transactions are missing from the disclosure report based on the reasoning provided. Users can also quickly adjust the mapping configurations to rectify the issue, if needed.', 'SpendMate’s© reporting module can also generate reports in different currencies and various numeric formats. SpendMate© offers users the choice of prepending or appending a currency code to the amount as per their requirements. The size of compliance teams can vary, therefore, SpendMate© allows for the saving of generated reports within the application. Saved reports can be accessed by everyone on the compliance team thereby reducing the need to constantly regenerate new reports. Reports from prior years can be maintained within the tool and are available for any updates or if a refreshed report is needed. Lastly, SpendMate© has an extensive audit trail capability that includes archiving/audit information on who generated which report, when it was generated, what the', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ninput parameters were, et cetera, allowing the compliance team to keep track of historical information and effectively respond to audit and exception inquires. In conclusion, SpendMate© is designed to simplify compliance transparency reporting on a global scale by supporting healthcare companies through every step of the process.

EngageMate© is an HCP/HCO engagements tool developed by Cresen Solutions that enables our clients to fully track HCP and\", 'HCO  engagements throughout the entire life cycle. The system is designed to automate the business lifecycle of any fee for service engagement from business planning through close-out. It will also serve as the auditable system of record for all associated HCP/HCO fee-based contractual arrangements.  There are many problems to be solved in the engagement lifecycle, EngageMate shines in the way it solves these problems.     Below in figure 1 is a diagram of the entire lifecycle that is commonly utilized within the Life Sciences Industry when fee for service contractual services are required:', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\n Figure 1: HCP Engagement Lifecycle All life sciences companies hire health care professionals (HCPs), organizations (HCOs), and other service providers. Engaging a service provider is often a lengthy process with many moving pieces and interactions between departments. During that time, the Compliance department is attempting to keep track of, and approve, all activities and service providers to ensure compliance with external government regulations and internal company policies. The HCP engagement process involves workflow including fair market value (FMV) assessments and exceptions, activity concept reviews, nomination review and approvals, content review/approvals, monetary spend capture, and appropriate certification and activity close-out. As an added layer of complexity, the events can be held around the globe with service providers from many countries, all of whom need their own respective', \"cross-border workflows. While it is possible to track the engagement process via spreadsheets, word documents, and emails, this can be messy and error prone. In today's age of big data and required government reporting, the difficult task of manually tracking engagements is quickly becoming impossible. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have an easy-to-use system where a company can track and manage activities, approvals, and FMV tiers and rates all in one place.  EngageMate© is an elegant system that solves all the problems associated with the engagement lifecycle.  Recently, after an unsatisfactory experience with another engagement tool, a top pharmaceutical company returned to tracking their activities with emails, spreadsheets, and word documents. Cresen Solutions was then brought in to implement EngageMate©. After gathering business requirements around workflow requirements, business rules, and input forms EngageMate© was configured to meet all of the client’s policies and\", 'SOPs.

Review workflows were created for each region within the company enabling a smooth process for the activity to be reviewed by multiple departments and reviewers across the globe. After the workflows are completed EngageMate© assures proper closure and certification processes aligned with company policy. EngageMate© uses all the latest technologies and uses common open integration methodologies to enable easy interfacing with other company business systems.  From adding service providers to filling out forms and submitting activities, business users have enjoyed EngageMate’s© responsiveness and ease of use. Most users were able to pick up the navigation and use of the system after one self-guided training session. Everyone, both “Submitters” and “Reviewers”, receive', \"email notifications when an activity is ready for their action. The email provides an embedded hyperlink that takes users directly to the activity they need to take action on. Additionally, upon logging into EngageMate©, users are presented with a simple landing page showing tiles that separate activities into distinct categories allowing users to see a filtered list of activities to find any activity they are looking for expeditiously. It also includes customizable dashboards that pull information from the system in real-time to provide metrics for activities, service providers used, approvals, and close-out alerts.  Given the ever-changing nature of the life sciences industry and government reporting, flexibility is a top priority for all Cresen Solutions’ product offerings, including EngageMate©. It is easy to create and edit any of the system's forms and needs assessment qualifications from the user interface, including quickly changing language translations. In the most recent\", \"implementation of EngageMate©, the system is translated into Japanese, with the help of translation vendors and the users themselves.

Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways.

EngageMate© is an elegant system that solves all the problems associated with the engagement lifecycle.  Recently, after an unsatisfactory experience with another engagement tool, a top pharmaceutical company returned to tracking their activities with emails, spreadsheets, and word documents.

Cresen Solutions developed MonitorMate© to enable our clients to easily assess global\", 'risk, create a calibrated monitoring plan, and track the execution of compliance monitoring and associated remedial events. The system is designed to automate the monitoring process of any company’s unique business need – from the risk assessment to the corrective action tracking for issues identified throughout the monitoring process. Additionally, the system has an automated workflow and email notification capability that eases the monitoring and remediation process of the company.    \\n Figure 1: Risk Monitoring Lifecycle.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nRisk management, auditing, and monitoring processes allow Life Science companies to conform with state and federal regulations while enabling them to also align with relevant internal policies and procedures. Within most companies, the global compliance department identifies potential risks through the execution of their ongoing monitoring process. Assessing the risk enables the organizations to identify weaknesses within the internal controls and identify policies and procedures that should be corrected. Companies can then take necessary corrective actions which ultimately can reduce the number of high-risk issues in the future. Additionally, the compliance department must monitor and document business events and interactions. Most companies lack flexibility and sophistication in identifying and mitigating their risk areas, monitoring, and auditing phases. The majority of these details are often tracked', 'through Excel sheets, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error. This manual tracking process becomes even more complex when the compliance teams are located across the globe in regions with varying international laws. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a refined system where companies can conduct a risk assessment, track monitoring, and remediation details, and easily assess the corrective measures. MonitorMate© is a refined system that seamlessly resolves many of the challenges associated within the risk monitoring lifecycle. Cresen Solutions prides itself on the satisfaction of our clients and the resulting associated improvements in business practices gained by switching from an outdated Excel-based approach to MonitorMate©. The system uses a simple question-based approach to evaluate global risk. The calculated risk value is then split into different ranges with corresponding colors which allows users to easily identify the activities with increased risk.', \"MonitorMate© supports single sign-on (SSO) and can also be integrated with different company source systems like an HR employee feed or a field-based sales roster Where MonitorMate© really shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented within the system without hardcoding and business interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a default value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time. MonitorMate© provides users with a comprehensive set of dashboards – accessible to all levels of the organization – to facilitate the real-time monitoring remediation and escalation of data captured within the system. For example, dynamic visuals such as heat maps are created with real-time data that helps the users to visualize\", '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ncolor-coded risk ratings to quickly identify risk severity. Dashboards, and sensitive or targeted information, can be aligned to different user roles created within the system, based on specific client requirements.  In many companies, compliance organizations can have large geographically dispersed structures with different roles and regions – within MonitorMate© we can customize the logic and associated dashboards to allow users restricted access to specific and relevant data for their regional and/or role assignments. Finally, any system must have the flexibility to support how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable. This problem is compounded as the user base grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. MonitorMate© allows user profiles to be easily managed by an administrator role.  Administrators can add', 'and remove users, limit the user to a specified region, change their assigned region, and change their role in the system. For example, a “monitor” role can assign an activity to multiple reviewers, which allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while a reviewer is out of the office. One of our recent clients had a specific business need that no other monitoring platform could effectively support. We developed a solution that catered to our client’s needs and allowed them to better capture their rep-ride monitoring data. This not only highlights MonitorMate’s© flexibility to accommodate specific business needs, but it ultimately resulted in a more sophisticated approach for capturing, analyzing, and identifying gaps in the field-based compliance monitoring process. In conclusion, MonitorMate© is a simple, yet powerful tool focusing on usability and flexibility that solves the problems presented by the Risk Monitoring lifecycle.

SpendMate© is a healthcare compliance transparency tool designed to streamline the end-to-end business process of transparency reporting.\", 'Like other offerings in the Cresen Solutions suite, SpendMate© was created in partnership with our life sciences and pharmaceutical customers. SpendMate© enables companies to meet the growing demand for transparency between industry and medical providers in the form of report preparation, generation, and submission, doing so cost-effectively, and it also easily scales with companies as they expand globally. Transparency reporting has complex requirements, SpendMate© excels in the way it enables healthcare companies to efficiently navigate these requirements. All healthcare companies engage with medical professionals and organizations for various events and other engagements. Transactions from these interactions can include a service fee for speaking at an event, reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, and more. By law, or code, these transactions must be reported in each country where applicable and be made publicly available. Since the governing body can change based on', 'the country or region, the reporting requirements also differ. Another layer of complexity includes intricate business rules that are used to evaluate which transactions are reportable or not. While these reports can be created manually, doing so can prove error prone and time-consuming for compliance teams. When dealing with large numbers of transactions, manually determining which are to be reported is both inefficient and is generally considered poor business practice.  SpendMate© simplifies the spend reporting process by providing the flexibility and scalability needed by our clients to meet the compliance demands of external entities. Recently, SpendMate’s© reporting module was successfully implemented at a top 10 pharmaceutical company, providing greater control and configurability over their previous reporting solution.

To add a layer of data security, Data Coordinators can be assigned to specific countries and will only have access to the', 'assigned country’s data and reports. Lastly, the Data Entry role can be assigned to vendors giving them access to specific forms to enter transactions for commercial and research engagements.

Cresen Solutions developed MonitorMate© to enable our clients to easily assess global\", 'risk, create a calibrated monitoring plan, and track the execution of compliance monitoring and associated remedial events. The system is designed to automate the monitoring process of any company’s unique business need – from the risk assessment to the corrective action tracking for issues identified throughout the monitoring process.

Within most companies, the global compliance department identifies potential risks through the execution of their ongoing monitoring process. Assessing the risk enables the organizations to identify weaknesses within the internal controls and identify policies and procedures that should be corrected. Companies can then take necessary corrective actions which ultimately can reduce the number of high-risk issues in the future. Additionally, the compliance department must monitor and document business events and interactions. Most companies lack flexibility and sophistication in identifying and mitigating their risk areas, monitoring, and auditing phases. The majority of these details are often tracked', 'through Excel sheets, which can be cumbersome and prone to human error. This manual tracking process becomes even more complex when the compliance teams are located across the globe in regions with varying international laws. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have a refined system where companies can conduct a risk assessment, track monitoring, and remediation details, and easily assess the corrective measures. MonitorMate© is a refined system that seamlessly resolves many of the challenges associated within the risk monitoring lifecycle. Cresen Solutions prides itself on the satisfaction of our clients and the resulting associated improvements in business practices gained by switching from an outdated Excel-based approach to MonitorMate©. The system uses a simple question-based approach to evaluate global risk. The calculated risk value is then split into different ranges with corresponding colors which allows users to easily identify the activities with increased risk.', \"MonitorMate© supports single sign-on (SSO) and can also be integrated with different company source systems like an HR employee feed or a field-based sales roster Where MonitorMate© really shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine. This allows for business rules to be implemented within the system without hardcoding and business interruption. With the rules engine, questions can be required, disabled, hidden, or populated with a default value either by themselves or based on another question's answer. Changes in the rules engine, or the configuration of forms and questions, can be seen in real-time. MonitorMate© provides users with a comprehensive set of dashboards – accessible to all levels of the organization – to facilitate the real-time monitoring remediation and escalation of data captured within the system.

Dashboards, and sensitive or targeted information, can be aligned to different user roles created within the system, based on specific client requirements.  In many companies, compliance organizations can have large geographically dispersed structures with different roles and regions – within MonitorMate© we can customize the logic and associated dashboards to allow users restricted access to specific and relevant data for their regional and/or role assignments. Finally, any system must have the flexibility to support how users are created and assigned. Even in a small workforce, changes are inevitable. This problem is compounded as the user base grows; therefore, it is paramount to have a process in place to accommodate these personnel changes. MonitorMate© allows user profiles to be easily managed by an administrator role.  Administrators can add', 'and remove users, limit the user to a specified region, change their assigned region, and change their role in the system. For example, a “monitor” role can assign an activity to multiple reviewers, which allows for the workflow to never get “stuck” waiting for someone’s action while a reviewer is out of the office. One of our recent clients had a specific business need that no other monitoring platform could effectively support. We developed a solution that catered to our client’s needs and allowed them to better capture their rep-ride monitoring data. This not only highlights MonitorMate’s© flexibility to accommodate specific business needs, but it ultimately resulted in a more sophisticated approach for capturing, analyzing, and identifying gaps in the field-based compliance monitoring process.

SpendMate© is a healthcare compliance transparency tool designed to streamline the end-to-end business process of transparency reporting.\", 'Like other offerings in the Cresen Solutions suite, SpendMate© was created in partnership with our life sciences and pharmaceutical customers. SpendMate© enables companies to meet the growing demand for transparency between industry and medical providers in the form of report preparation, generation, and submission, doing so cost-effectively, and it also easily scales with companies as they expand globally. Transparency reporting has complex requirements, SpendMate© excels in the way it enables healthcare companies to efficiently navigate these requirements. All healthcare companies engage with medical professionals and organizations for various events and other engagements. Transactions from these interactions can include a service fee for speaking at an event, reimbursement of travel and accommodation expenses, and more. By law, or code, these transactions must be reported in each country where applicable and be made publicly available. Since the governing body can change based on', 'the country or region, the reporting requirements also differ. Another layer of complexity includes intricate business rules that are used to evaluate which transactions are reportable or not. While these reports can be created manually, doing so can prove error prone and time-consuming for compliance teams. When dealing with large numbers of transactions, manually determining which are to be reported is both inefficient and is generally considered poor business practice.  SpendMate© simplifies the spend reporting process by providing the flexibility and scalability needed by our clients to meet the compliance demands of external entities. Recently, SpendMate’s© reporting module was successfully implemented at a top 10 pharmaceutical company, providing greater control and configurability over their previous reporting solution. SpendMate© provides efficiency in form and function by having a user-friendly interface that is driven by a configurable business logic engine. This provides the', 'ability to add or remove attributes and business rules at any time without impacting legacy data. The key versatility of SpendMate© lies within its fully customizable forms and templates, allowing Cresen Solutions to', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ntailor the data entry forms and reporting templates to align with the needs of each client. Using SpendMate’s© end-to-end process, data can be imported from various engagement management systems, processed, validated, and reported using the built-in reporting module.  When operating on a global scale across different countries, users and user permissions must be managed effectively. User roles within SpendMate© are broken into 3 categories, Administrative, Data Coordinator, and Data Entry. Administrative accounts have access to all data and functionalities within SpendMate© and also have the ability to perform system administration and configuration. Data-Coordinators can create and edit transactions and submit them for verification as well as generate country-specific spend reports. To add a layer of data security, Data Coordinators can be assigned to specific countries and will only have access to the', 'assigned country’s data and reports. Lastly, the Data Entry role can be assigned to vendors giving them access to specific forms to enter transactions for commercial and research engagements. Users and their roles can be quickly set up or adjusted by the admins, ensuring a quick transition during times of employee turnover. Below in Figure 1 is an architecture diagram that showcases the different aspects of SpendMate©. \\n Figure 1: SpendMate© Architecture Diagram One key area in which SpendMate© excels is through its various activity management system integrations, allowing SpendMate© to receive a constant flow of data in relation to new events and other engagements between healthcare companies and medical professionals and organizations. The data received from these activity management systems is then cleaned and transformed before being displayed. To streamline the user’s access to SpendMate©, single sign-on integrations are supported but not required. Users can review and validate', 'the data within SpendMate© and use its built-in reporting module to generate spend reports specific to each country.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nTo ensure the accuracy of medical professional and organization customer records, SpendMate© has a partnership with Veeva Open Data and can integrate with other third-party vendors that maintain customer reference data to match the unique customer profiles. SpendMate© can be configured to send a request to a client’s customer master using an API call, and the returned match responses will be displayed for the user to select the matching customer profile. Additionally, SpendMate© supports automatic matching of the customer profiles if certain unique identifiers are present, such as the NPI number or other local identifiers. If duplicate customer profiles exist, SpendMate© has the added functionality of merging and unmerging customers to address these issues. One of the key features of SpendMate© is its reporting module, which supports the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations', '(EFPIA) reports, European Local Law reports, and U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports, Patient Organization (PO) reports, and other country specific reports (Brazil, Colombia, etc.). Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways. For that reason, SpendMate© allows our clients to determine which interactions are reportable and not reportable through business rules using mappings at the country and report type level. The same approach is applied to professional types, for example, a nurse might be reportable in Norway, but not in Switzerland, this can be easily handled through the mapping configurations of each country. For the purposes of validation, a validation file is automatically generated along with each report, following the same input parameters selected on the UI. Within the validation file are two key columns; if the transaction is included on the report and if not, the reason why it is excluded. The validation file can be used to quickly determine why certain transactions are missing from the disclosure report based on the reasoning provided. Users can also quickly adjust the mapping configurations to rectify the issue, if needed.', 'SpendMate’s© reporting module can also generate reports in different currencies and various numeric formats. SpendMate© offers users the choice of prepending or appending a currency code to the amount as per their requirements. The size of compliance teams can vary, therefore, SpendMate© allows for the saving of generated reports within the application. Saved reports can be accessed by everyone on the compliance team thereby reducing the need to constantly regenerate new reports. Reports from prior years can be maintained within the tool and are available for any updates or if a refreshed report is needed. Lastly, SpendMate© has an extensive audit trail capability that includes archiving/audit information on who generated which report, when it was generated, what the', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\ninput parameters were, et cetera, allowing the compliance team to keep track of historical information and effectively respond to audit and exception inquires. In conclusion, SpendMate© is designed to simplify compliance transparency reporting on a global scale by supporting healthcare companies through every step of the process. SpendMate’s© ability to adapt paired with its flexibility allows our clients to thrive in the ever-changing landscape of compliance reporting.

EngageMate© is an HCP/HCO engagements tool developed by Cresen Solutions that enables our clients to fully track HCP and\", 'HCO  engagements throughout the entire life cycle. The system is designed to automate the business lifecycle of any fee for service engagement from business planning through close-out. It will also serve as the auditable system of record for all associated HCP/HCO fee-based contractual arrangements.  There are many problems to be solved in the engagement lifecycle, EngageMate shines in the way it solves these problems.     Below in figure 1 is a diagram of the entire lifecycle that is commonly utilized within the Life Sciences Industry when fee for service contractual services are required:', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\n Figure 1: HCP Engagement Lifecycle All life sciences companies hire health care professionals (HCPs), organizations (HCOs), and other service providers. Engaging a service provider is often a lengthy process with many moving pieces and interactions between departments. During that time, the Compliance department is attempting to keep track of, and approve, all activities and service providers to ensure compliance with external government regulations and internal company policies. The HCP engagement process involves workflow including fair market value (FMV) assessments and exceptions, activity concept reviews, nomination review and approvals, content review/approvals, monetary spend capture, and appropriate certification and activity close-out. As an added layer of complexity, the events can be held around the globe with service providers from many countries, all of whom need their own respective', \"cross-border workflows. While it is possible to track the engagement process via spreadsheets, word documents, and emails, this can be messy and error prone. In today's age of big data and required government reporting, the difficult task of manually tracking engagements is quickly becoming impossible. Now, more than ever, it is essential to have an easy-to-use system where a company can track and manage activities, approvals, and FMV tiers and rates all in one place.  EngageMate© is an elegant system that solves all the problems associated with the engagement lifecycle.  Recently, after an unsatisfactory experience with another engagement tool, a top pharmaceutical company returned to tracking their activities with emails, spreadsheets, and word documents. Cresen Solutions was then brought in to implement EngageMate©. After gathering business requirements around workflow requirements, business rules, and input forms EngageMate© was configured to meet all of the client’s policies and\", 'SOPs.

Review workflows were created for each region within the company enabling a smooth process for the activity to be reviewed by multiple departments and reviewers across the globe. After the workflows are completed EngageMate© assures proper closure and certification processes aligned with company policy. EngageMate© uses all the latest technologies and uses common open integration methodologies to enable easy interfacing with other company business systems.  From adding service providers to filling out forms and submitting activities, business users have enjoyed EngageMate’s© responsiveness and ease of use. Most users were able to pick up the navigation and use of the system after one self-guided training session. Everyone, both “Submitters” and “Reviewers”, receive', \"email notifications when an activity is ready for their action. The email provides an embedded hyperlink that takes users directly to the activity they need to take action on. Additionally, upon logging into EngageMate©, users are presented with a simple landing page showing tiles that separate activities into distinct categories allowing users to see a filtered list of activities to find any activity they are looking for expeditiously. It also includes customizable dashboards that pull information from the system in real-time to provide metrics for activities, service providers used, approvals, and close-out alerts.  Given the ever-changing nature of the life sciences industry and government reporting, flexibility is a top priority for all Cresen Solutions’ product offerings, including EngageMate©. It is easy to create and edit any of the system's forms and needs assessment qualifications from the user interface, including quickly changing language translations. In the most recent\", \"implementation of EngageMate©, the system is translated into Japanese, with the help of translation vendors and the users themselves. Cresen Solutions can accommodate changes or updates to the translations rapidly without downtime. Where EngageMate© shines is in the flexibility of using its sophisticated rules engine.

Additionally, SpendMate© supports automatic matching of the customer profiles if certain unique identifiers are present, such as the NPI number or other local identifiers. If duplicate customer profiles exist, SpendMate© has the added functionality of merging and unmerging customers to address these issues. One of the key features of SpendMate© is its reporting module, which supports the European Federation of Pharmaceutical Industries and Associations', '(EFPIA) reports, European Local Law reports, and U.S Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services (CMS) reports, Patient Organization (PO) reports, and other country specific reports (Brazil, Colombia, etc.). Given that the healthcare compliance landscape is constantly evolving with new regulations and requirements being implemented, it is important that SpendMate© can adapt to these changes. As reporting templates and business rules change, the reporting module allows for easy configuration with very little or no development effort. The reporting module also gives users the option of multi-language report generation at the country level. One of the input parameters to generate a report is the start and end dates, giving users the choice on the time-frame for their specific reporting output. For example, SpendMate’s© reports can display monthly, quarterly, and yearly transactions, or even those within specific date ranges.  Interactions between healthcare companies and medical', 'professionals and organizations can occur in a multitude of ways. For that reason, SpendMate© allows our clients to determine which interactions are reportable and not reportable through business rules using mappings at the country and report type level. The same approach is applied to professional types, for example, a nurse might be reportable in Norway, but not in Switzerland, this can be easily handled through the mapping configurations of each country. For the purposes of validation, a validation file is automatically generated along with each report, following the same input parameters selected on the UI. Within the validation file are two key columns; if the transaction is included on the report and if not, the reason why it is excluded. The validation file can be used to quickly determine why certain transactions are missing from the disclosure report based on the reasoning provided. Users can also quickly adjust the mapping configurations to rectify the issue, if needed.', '666 Exton Commons    Exton PA 19341                    (484) 879-426   \\n   \\nPayments data in a unique and innovative way.
